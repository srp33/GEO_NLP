1. Transcriptomic Analysis of Isolated Monocytes from heathy donors and JIA patinets using Nanostring Technology
(Submitter supplied) Among immune cells, activated monocytes play a detrimental role in chronic and viral-induced  inflammatory pathologies. The uncontrolled activation of monocytes and the subsequent  excessive production of inflammatory factors damage bone-cartilage joints in Juvenile  Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), a childhood rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. The moderate  beneficial effect of current therapies and clinical trials highlights the need of alternative  strategies targeting monocytes to treat RA disease. more...

We demonstrate that active JIA is associated with distinct alterations in CD4+ T cell chromatin, as assessed by ATAC-seq studies.  However, 3D chromatin architecture, assessed by HiChIP and simultaneous mapping of CTCF anchors of chromatin loops, reveals that normal 3D chromatin architecture is largely preserved in JIA CD4+ T cells. more...

Identifying the causative pathogen as quickly as possible is crucial to initiate the most optimal therapy, as acute bacterial meningitis is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics, as opposed to enteroviral meningitis, which only requires supportive therapy. Clinical presentation is usually not sufficient to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis, thereby necessitating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis by PCR and/or time-consuming bacterial cultures. more...

31. Complexity and Specificity of the Neutrophil Transcriptome in Diverse Inflammatory States
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils, cells generally regarded as nonspecific in their functions and responses.  We studied distinct human disease phenotypes and found that, at the gene, gene isoform, and miRNA level, neutrophils exhibit considerable specificity in their transcriptomes.  These findings were particularly striking for isoform usage.  Thus, even cells whose responses are considered non-specific show tailoring of their transcriptional repertoire toward specific physiologic or pathologic contexts. more...

36. Common Immunologic Pathways Between Oligoarticular and Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
(Submitter supplied) The polyarticular and oligoarticular forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are classified as distinct entities. At the same time, many children who present with an oligoarticular phenotype eventually evolve to a polyarticular disease pattern, suggesting that the phenotypes might share with overlapping molecular mechanisms. Using gene expression microarrays, we found that 14 genes in neutrophils and 55 genes in PBMC shows common patterns of differential expression when children with active oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA were compared with healthy controls. more...

38. Expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs located in autoimmune disease-associated regions reveal immune cell type specificity
(Submitter supplied) Background: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of variants associated with risk of autoimmune and immune-related disorders (AID), our understanding of the diseases mechanisms is limited. In particular, more than 90% of the risk variants lie in non-coding regions, and almost 10% of these map to long non-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are known to show more cell-type specificity than protein-coding genes. more...
