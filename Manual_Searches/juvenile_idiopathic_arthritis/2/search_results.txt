2. CDK5RAP3 is activated by master TFs and regulates ER-Phagy in neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit associated protein 3(CDK5RAP3) is regulated by master TFs in neuroblastoma, and its functions in neuroblastoma are yet unclear. Herein, we observed a significantly elevated CDK5RAP3 expression level in neuroblastoma, which was associated with a poor prognosis in patients.  CDK5RAP3 promotes the growth of neuroblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, defective CDK5RAP3 interferes with UFMylation system, thereby triggering endoplasmic reticulum(ER)-Phagy. more...

4. Von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor controls m6A-dependent gene expression in renal tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) N6‐Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal post‐translational modification, and its contribution to cancer evolution has recently been appreciated. Renal cancer is the most common adult genitourinary cancer, of which ~85% is accounted for by the clear cell subtype (ccRCC) characterized by VHL loss. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that VHL binds with m6A enzymatic complex proteins and promotes METTL3-METTL14 complex formation, and VHL depletion suppresses mRNA m6A modification. more...

5. ALKBH5 regulates paclitaxel resistance in NSCLC via inhibiting CEMIP-mediated EMT
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most printed and prevalent mRNA modification, which was verified to be closely correlated with cancer occurrence and progression. As m6A demethlyase, the dysregulation of ALKBH5 was observed in various cancer. However, the role and underlying machinery of ALKBH5 in NSCLC pathogenesis, especially the chemo-resistance was poorly elucidated. The current study indicated that ALKBH5 was decreased during paclitaxel (PTX) resistant process and its down-regulation usually implied poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. more...

9. Aberrant non-canonical NF-κB signalling reprograms the epigenome landscape to drive oncogenic transcriptomes in multiple myeloma [RNA2]
(Submitter supplied) In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells establish oncogenic niches within the bone marrow by engaging the NF-κB pathway to nurture their survival while they accumulate pro-proliferative mutations. Under these conditions, many cases eventually develop genetic abnormalities endowing them with constitutive NF-κB activation. Here, we find that sustained NF-κB/p52 levels resulting from such mutations favours the recruitment of enhancers beyond the normal B-cell repertoire. more...

We defined CD8+ T-cell immunity directed at the prominent influenza epitope, HLA-A*02:01-M158-66 (A2/M158) across four age groups (newborns, children, adults and elderly) ex vivo at phenotypic, single cell sequence (transcriptomic), clonal and functional levels. We identified a linear differentiation trajectory from newborns to children then adults, followed by divergence and a clonal reset in older adults. more...

(Submitter supplied) The neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade therapy only benefits a limited fraction of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Thus, targeting other immunomodulators on myeloid cells is an attractive therapeutic option. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics of GBM patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy. We identified unique monocyte-derived tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations with functional plasticity that highly expressed the immunosuppressive SIGLEC9 gene and preferentially accumulated in the non-responders to anti-PD-1 treatment. more...

(Submitter supplied) Enolase 1 (ENO1) is a glycolytic enzyme that plays essential roles in various pathological activities including cancer development. However, the mechanisms underlying ENO1-contributed tumorigenesis are not well explained. Here, we uncover that ENO1, as an RNA-binding protein, binds to the cytosine-uracil-guanine-rich elements of YAP1 messenger RNA to promote its translation. ENO1 and YAP1 positively regulate alternative arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by inverse regulation of PLCB1 and HPGD (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase). more...

We discovered that the human p11 protein is a decisive factor for directing phagosomes either to the degradative or secretory pathway. The HscA protein present on the spore surface of the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus anchors p11 on the phagosome and thereby inhibits phagosome maturation that would result in for expulsion of spores. more...

(Submitter supplied) A translating ribosome is typically thought to follow the reading frame defined by the selected start codon. Using super-resolution ribosome profiling, here we report pervasive out-of-frame translation from the start codon. Unlike programmable frameshifting during elongation, start codon-associated ribosome frameshifting (SCARF) stems from the slippage of the initiating ribosome. Using a massively paralleled reporter assay, we uncovered sequence elements acting as SCARF enhancers or repressors, implying that start codon recognition is coupled with reading frame fidelity. more...

153. BRD4 inhibitor GNE987 exerts anti-cancer effects in Neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, which is derived from primordial neural crest cells. GNE987 is a newly developed von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)-based pan-BET-targeting PROTAC, which can bind to the target proteins (BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) and recruit them to the ubiquitin/ proteasome system for selective degradation. However, the function of GNE987 has not been assessed in NB models so far. more...

157. Probiotic normalization of systemic inflammation in siblings of Type 1 diabetes patients
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND.  The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has significantly increased in recent decades and coincides with lifestyle changes that have likely altered the composition of the gut microbiota.  Dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction are associated with T1D, and notably, our studies have identified an inflammatory state in T1D families that is consistent microbial antigen exposure.     METHODS.  We conducted a 6-week, single-arm, open-label trial to investigate whether daily multi-strain probiotic (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus) supplementation could reduce the familial inflammatory state in 25 unaffected siblings of diabetes patients.    RESULTS.  Probiotic supplementation was found safe and well-tolerated; there were no adverse events and participant adherence was 93%.  Bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequencing of stool revealed that community alpha and beta diversity were not altered between the pre- and post-supplement samplings.  LEfSe analyses identified post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid butyrate.  Systemic inflammation was measured by plasma induced transcription and quantified with a gene ontology-based composite inflammatory index (I.I.com).  After supplementation, I.I.com was reduced (p=0.017), and pathway analysis predicted inhibition of IL17A, lipopolysaccharide, NFkB, IL1B, and TNF (Z-score≤-2.0) and activation of IL10RA (Z-score=2.0).  Post-supplement plasma levels of IL12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2, CCL24 were reduced (p<0.05), while butyrate levels trended 2.4-fold higher (p=0.06).    CONCLUSION.  There is a substantial need for safe, broadly applicable therapies to reduce T1D susceptibility.  This study indicates that investigations of prebiotic and probiotic strategies are warranted as they may be efficacious either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents.

222. Suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating FZD1 under hypoxia
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer (BrCa) deaths; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we report that suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing under hypoxia, which favors the production of MBD2a, facilitates BrCa metastasis. Specifically, we found that MBD2a promotes, whereas its less-known short form MBD2c suppresses metastasis. We elucidate that HIF-1 activation under hypoxia facilitates MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing and, as a result, the elevated MBD2a outcompetes MBD2c for binding to the promoter CpG islands to activate the expression of FZD1, thereby promoting EMT and metastasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized system-based cell pathway analysis. The purposes of this study were to compare and analyze the expression differences of skin squamous cell line A431 in stem cells after Mir-22 deletion. Methods: mRNA profiles of  control and case cells were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods:Bowtie2 to map clean reads to reference gene and use HISAT to reference genome.Bowtie2 parameters forSE reads:-q--phred64--sensitive--dpad0--gbar and HISTAparameters forSE reads:-p8--phred64--sensitive-I1-X 1000. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 24 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome (build hg19) and identified 17000 transcripts in control and case cells with RSEM workflow.  Approximately 5% of the transcripts showed differential expression between  control and case cells, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.01. Altered expression of 10 candidate genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method.

361. 3D genome of multiple myeloma reveals spatial genome disorganization associated with copy number variations
(Submitter supplied) Hi-C technique has been widely applied to study the three-dimensional architecture of the whole genome. Genome structures such as compartment A/B, TAD (topologically associated domain) and chromatin loops can be identified from Hi-C data in both normal cells of human and other species, and are found to be associated with features such as epigenetic markers, DNA-binding proteins and gene expression. But such technique had been rarely used in cancer studies. Here we used Hi-C to study the aneuploid cancer genomic architecture in multiple myeloma cells. Our results indicate that Hi-C interaction matrix of cancer cells is affected by CNVs and should be adjusted for copy number. After correcting this CNV bias, we found a significant overlapping between the boundaries of CNV blocks and boundaries of TADs, which suggests that TAD boundaries are fragile sites for CNV breakpoints. In addition, the compartment A/B switching is associated with differential gene expression, from which we found important genes that are related with multiple myeloma. We build a 3D structure model of the aneuploidy genome and found that there are great changes both in the whole genome spatial interactome and local chromosome territories. In summary, our research builds the first 3D genome interaction maps of multiple myeloma and the first time notice this CNV-driven bias in Hi-C studies, which may deepen our understanding of changes in cancer 3D genome.

The aim is to determine the role of AJUBA in colorectal tumorigenesis. Methods:  We performed data mining in Oncomine databases and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays on 67 paired colorectal cancer (CRC) samples; we manipulated the AJUBA expression in SW-1116 and Caco-2 cells using specific shRNA and overexpression plasmids and performed assays for cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis; we performed RNA-seq and qRT-PCR assays to identify genes regulated by AJUBA; we performed western blot, co-immunoprecipitation assays to study the interaction of AJUBA and JAK/STAT; Results: We discovered that AJUBA is highly expressed in CRC and promotes CRC cell growth in culture and in xenograted mice via an inhibition of apoptosis by repression of the IFIT2 gene. more...

394. Gene expression data of whole blood of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) patients treated with canakinumab or placebo and age matched healthy controls
(Submitter supplied) Canakinumab is a human anti-interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-1 beta. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a rare, multigenic, autoinflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by chronic arthritis; intermittent high-spiking fever, rash, and elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. Blood samples of SJIA patients were obtained from two phase 3 clinical trials conducted by the members of the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) and the Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group (PRCSG) (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00886769 and NCT00889863). more...

395. A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. more...

(Submitter supplied) The natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could be divided in different phases by transaminase and HBV replication levels. However, it remains unknown how the intrahepatic transcriptomes in patients are correlated with the clinical phases. Here, we determined the intrahepatic transcriptomes of chronic hepatitis B patients and examined the role of specific groups of genes, including immune-related genes, in the control of hepatitis B virus infection.

407. Complexity and Specificity of the Neutrophil Transcriptome in Diverse Inflammatory States
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils, cells generally regarded as nonspecific in their functions and responses.  We studied distinct human disease phenotypes and found that, at the gene, gene isoform, and miRNA level, neutrophils exhibit considerable specificity in their transcriptomes.  These findings were particularly striking for isoform usage.  Thus, even cells whose responses are considered non-specific show tailoring of their transcriptional repertoire toward specific physiologic or pathologic contexts. more...

413. Identification of diffrentially expressed genes upon DDSR1 knockdown
(Submitter supplied) Upon DNA damage, the DNA damage response (DDR) elicits a complex signaling cascade, which includes the induction of multiple non-coding RNA species. Recently long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to contribute to DDR by regulating gene expression. However, very little is known about the role that lncRNAs play in regulating DNA Repair. Using a genome-wide microarray screen we identified a novel ubiquitously expressed lncRNA, DDSR1 (DNA damage-sensitive RNA 1), which is induced upon DNA damage by several DNA double-strand break (DSB) agents. more...

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. more...

445. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

506. Reprogramming human fat cells into iPS cells
(Submitter supplied) This study determined whether human adipose stem cells (hASCs) could be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using the 4 factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC. We showed successfull reprogramming could be achieved in which fat/adipose cells were able to assume embryonic-like phenotypes after lentiviral transduction with the 4 factors. Further, we believe these fat cells are intrinsically better-suited for reprogramming compared to fibroblasts, and result in higher yields of iPS cells.

507. Egr1 regulates the coordinated expression of numerous EGF receptor target genes as identified by ChIP-on-chip
(Submitter supplied) Previous studies have revealed that UV-stimulation of a variety of cells leads to activation of the EGF receptor, induction of Egr1, growth inhibition and apoptosis.  On the other hand both Egr1 and EGF receptor activation are implicated in promoting the progression of prostate cancer.  We treated M12 tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells which express little Egr1 with UV irradiation which rapidly activated the EGF receptor and elevated Egr1. more...

511. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: peripheral blood cells
(Submitter supplied) Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (soJIA) is a rheumatic disease in childhood characterized by systemic symptoms and a relatively poor prognosis. The peripheral leukocytes are thought to play the pathological role of soJIA although the exact cause is still obscure. In this study, we aimed to clarify the cellular functional abnormality in those cells. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile in peripheral leukocytes from 51 patients with soJIA, 6 patients with poly-articular type JIA (polyJIA) and 8 healthy children utilizing DNA microarrays. more...

515. Blood Leukocyte Microarrays to Diagnose Systemic Onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Follow IL-1 blocade
(Submitter supplied) Systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SoJIA) represents up to 20% of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). We have previously reported that this disease is Interleukin 1 (IL1)-mediated, and that IL-1 blockade results in clinical remission in the majority of patients. The diagnosis of SoJIA, however, still relies on clinical findings as no specific diagnostic tests are available, which leads to delays in the initiation of specific therapy. more...
