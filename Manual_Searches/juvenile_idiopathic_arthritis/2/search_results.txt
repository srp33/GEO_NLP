(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most printed and prevalent mRNA modification, which was verified to be closely correlated with cancer occurrence and progression. As m6A demethlyase, the dysregulation of ALKBH5 was observed in various cancer. However, the role and underlying machinery of ALKBH5 in NSCLC pathogenesis, especially the chemo-resistance was poorly elucidated. The current study indicated that ALKBH5 was decreased during paclitaxel (PTX) resistant process and its down-regulation usually implied poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. more...

5. Aberrant non-canonical NF-κB signalling reprograms the epigenome landscape to drive oncogenic transcriptomes in multiple myeloma [RNA2]
(Submitter supplied) In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells establish oncogenic niches within the bone marrow by engaging the NF-κB pathway to nurture their survival while they accumulate pro-proliferative mutations. Under these conditions, many cases eventually develop genetic abnormalities endowing them with constitutive NF-κB activation. Here, we find that sustained NF-κB/p52 levels resulting from such mutations favours the recruitment of enhancers beyond the normal B-cell repertoire. more...

13. Gene expression changes upon the ablation of mesenchymal androgen receptor (AR) in the mouse mesonephroi
(Submitter supplied) Wolffian duct maintenance and differentiation is predominantly driven by the androgen action, which is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). It is well established that the mesenchyme indicates the fate and differentiation of epithelial cells. However, in vivo developmental requirement of mesenchymal AR in Wolffian duct development is still undefined. By designing a mesenchyme-specific Ar knockout (ARKO), we discovered that the loss of mesenchymal Ar led to the bilateral or unilateral degeneration of caudal Wolffian ducts and cystic formation at the cranial Wolffian ducts. more...

74. Newborn and child-like molecular signatures in older adults stem from TCR shifts across human lifespan
(Submitter supplied) CD8+ T-cells provide robust anti-viral immunity, yet how epitope-specific T-cells evolve across the human lifespan is unknown. We defined CD8+ T-cell immunity directed at the prominent influenza epitope, HLA-A*02:01-M158-66 (A2/M158) across four age groups (newborns, children, adults and elderly) ex vivo at phenotypic, single cell sequence (transcriptomic), clonal and functional levels. We identified a linear differentiation trajectory from newborns to children then adults, followed by divergence and a clonal reset in older adults. more...

We found that only 30% of ovaries with substantial mutant GCs developed into GCTs that derived from a single mutant GC. In-depth molecular analysis of the process of tumorigenesis demonstrated that up-regulation of immune evasion genes Cd24a and Cd47 led, in part, to the transition of mutant GCs to GCTs. more...

111. ZFP750 regulates skin lipid metabolism and cutaneous barrier
(Submitter supplied) A life-essential function of the epidermis is to provide a physical barrier that prevents the loss of water and electrolytes. Essential mediators of this permeability barrier function include ceramides, cholesterol and very long chain fatty acids. Accordingly, their alteration may lead to distinct human conditions, including psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Recently, a frameshift mutation in the human ZNF750 gene, that encodes for a zinc finger transcription factor, causing a seborrhea-like dermatitis with psoriasiform element, has brought ZNF750 as a key element for the maintenance of the epidermal tissue homeostasis. more...

114. ZmNRT1.1B (ZmNPF6.6) determines nitrogen use efficiency via regulation of nitrate transport and assimilation in maize
(Submitter supplied) Nitrate (NO3-) is crucial for optimal plant growth and development and often limits crop productivity at the low availability. In comparison with model plant Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanisms underlying NO3- acquisition and utilization remain largely unclear in maize. In particular, only a few genes have been exploited to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Here, we demonstrated that NO3--inducible ZmNRT1.1B (ZmNPF6.6) positively regulated NO3--dependent growth and NUE in maize. more...

(Submitter supplied) The decision whether endosomes in mammalian cells enter the degradative or non-degradative pathway is of fundamental importance for killing of ingested pathogens and an essential basic mechanism whose malfunctioning has pathological consequences. We discovered that the human p11 protein is a decisive factor for directing phagosomes either to the degradative or secretory pathway. The HscA protein present on the spore surface of the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus anchors p11 on the phagosome and thereby inhibits phagosome maturation that would result in for expulsion of spores. more...

235. The DEAD-box helicase Hlc regulates basal transcription and chromatin opening of stress-responsive genes
(Submitter supplied) Stress-responsive genes are lowly transcribed under normal conditions and robustly induced in response to stress. The significant difference between basal and induced transcription indicates that the general transcriptional machinery requires a mechanism to distinguish each transcription state. However, what factors specifically function in basal transcription remains poorly understood. Using a classic model stress-responsive gene (Drosophila MtnA), we found that knockdown of the DEAD-box helicase Hlc resulted in a significant transcription attenuation of MtnA under normal, but not stressed, conditions. more...

260. Peripherally-expressed apoE4 impairs brain functions and exacerbates amyloid pathogenesis by compromising cerebrovascular functions
(Submitter supplied) The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). ApoE is a lipid carrier abundantly expressed in both brain and periphery. As peripheral apoE is separated from brain apoE by the blood-brain barrier, it remains unclear whether peripheral apoE impacts brain functions and AD pathogenesis. To investigate this, we developed novel mouse models that conditionally express human APOE3 or APOE4 only in the liver with no detectable apoE in the brain. more...

301. Probiotic normalization of systemic inflammation in siblings of Type 1 diabetes patients
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND.  The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has significantly increased in recent decades and coincides with lifestyle changes that have likely altered the composition of the gut microbiota.  Dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction are associated with T1D, and notably, our studies have identified an inflammatory state in T1D families that is consistent microbial antigen exposure.     METHODS.  We conducted a 6-week, single-arm, open-label trial to investigate whether daily multi-strain probiotic (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus) supplementation could reduce the familial inflammatory state in 25 unaffected siblings of diabetes patients.    RESULTS.  Probiotic supplementation was found safe and well-tolerated; there were no adverse events and participant adherence was 93%.  Bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequencing of stool revealed that community alpha and beta diversity were not altered between the pre- and post-supplement samplings.  LEfSe analyses identified post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid butyrate.  Systemic inflammation was measured by plasma induced transcription and quantified with a gene ontology-based composite inflammatory index (I.I.com).  After supplementation, I.I.com was reduced (p=0.017), and pathway analysis predicted inhibition of IL17A, lipopolysaccharide, NFkB, IL1B, and TNF (Z-score≤-2.0) and activation of IL10RA (Z-score=2.0).  Post-supplement plasma levels of IL12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2, CCL24 were reduced (p<0.05), while butyrate levels trended 2.4-fold higher (p=0.06).    CONCLUSION.  There is a substantial need for safe, broadly applicable therapies to reduce T1D susceptibility.  This study indicates that investigations of prebiotic and probiotic strategies are warranted as they may be efficacious either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents.

361. Mitogen induced-nucleosomal response pathway and transcriptional programming in mammalian fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) Stimulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway activates mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSK) 1 and 2, which phosphorylate histone H3 at S10 (H3S10ph) or S28 (H3S28ph) (nucleosomal response) located at the regulatory regions of immediate-early genes, setting in motion a series of chromatin remodeling events that result in transcription initiation. To investigate immediate-early genes regulated by the MSK, we have completed transcriptome analyses (RNA Sequencing) of human normal fibroblast cells (CCD-1070Sk) stimulated with EGF or TPA ± H89, a potent MSK/PKA inhibitor.

428. Multi-omics analysis to study hepatitis B virus-host interaction
(Submitter supplied) Curing treatment for HBV infection is yet unavailable, mainly due to unmet gaps in current understanding of the details about HBV-host interaction. By quantitatively assessing HBV-induced global changes in host transcriptome, translatome and proteome, we identified multiple previously unknown transcriptional and translational events that HBV orchestrated to remodel host proteostasis networks and afford micro-environments essential for HBV proliferation and persistence.By delineating novel drug targets and biomarkers in HBV-host interaction, multi-omics interrogation may facilitate the development of next-generation therapeutics or diagnostics against HBV infection and the related maladies.

429. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with and activates TLR4
(Submitter supplied) We here identified that the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 could bind to TLR4 directly and robustly activate downstream signaling in monocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, specific TLR4 or NFKB inhibitor, or knockout of MyD88 could significantly block IL-1B induction by spike protein. We thus reveal that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a potent stimulus causing TLR4 activation and sepsis related abnormal responses.

439. Suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating FZD1 under hypoxia
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer (BrCa) deaths; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we report that suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing under hypoxia, which favors the production of MBD2a, facilitates BrCa metastasis. Specifically, we found that MBD2a promotes, whereas its less-known short form MBD2c suppresses metastasis. We elucidate that HIF-1 activation under hypoxia facilitates MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing and, as a result, the elevated MBD2a outcompetes MBD2c for binding to the promoter CpG islands to activate the expression of FZD1, thereby promoting EMT and metastasis. more...

526. Genome-wide High Resolution Mapping of Mitotic DNA Synthesis Sites and Common Fragile Sites by Direct Sequencing [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Common fragile sites (CFSs) are genomic loci prone to the formation of breaks or gaps on metaphase chromosomes.  Here, we seek to map human CFSs with high resolution on a genome-wide scale by sequencing the sites of mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDASeq) that are specific for CFSs. We generated a nucleotide-resolution atlas of MiDAS sites (MDSs) that covered most of know CFSs, and comprehensively analyzed their sequence characteristics and genomic features.

527. Comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis identifies key regulators of injury response and neurogenic competence in retinal glia
(Submitter supplied) Injury induces retinal Muller glia of non-mammalian, but not mammalian, vertebrates to generate neurons.  To identify gene regulatory networks that control neurogenic competence in retinal glia, we used bulk and single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis to comprehensively profile gene expression and chromatin conformation in Muller glia from zebrafish, chick and mice.  This was conducted during glial development, following inner and outer retinal injury, as well as following treatment with extrinsic factors that induce glial reprogramming. more...

540. CxxC Finger Protein 1-mediated Histone H3 Lysine-4 Trimethylation is Essential for Proper Meiotic Crossover Formation in Mice
(Submitter supplied) CXXC finger protein 1 (Cfp1) is a DNA-binding component of the SETD1 methyltransferase complex, targets SETD1A/B to most CpG islands (CpGI), and mediates the generation of H3K4me3. Deficiency of CFP1 in mice leads to pre-implantation lethality. Previous data suggest an indispensable role of CFP1 in germ cell development and meiosis. However, it remains unclear if CFP1-mediated H3K4 trimethylation is also required for the earliest stages of meiosis in both male and female germ cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common malignant intraocular tumor of childhood. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are longer than 200 bp and without protein-coding ability, are key regulators of tumorigenesis. However, the role of lncRNAs in retinoblastoma remains to be elucidated. METHODS: LncRNA CASC15-New-Transcript 1 (CANT1) expression was determined by real-time PCR in RB cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Reef-building corals live in a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic algae (family Symbiodiniaceae) that usually provide the bulk of the energy required by the coral host. This relationship is very sensitive to temperature stress, with as little as 1°C increase above mean in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) often leading to the collapse of the association. The meta-stability  of these associations has led to interest in the potential of more stress tolerant algae to supplement or substitute for the normal Symbiodiniaceae mutualists. more...

598. Defining an evolutionarily conserved role of GW182 in circular RNA degradation.
(Submitter supplied) By using dsRNA screening, we found that GW182 is critical for the degradation of circRNA in the Drosophila cells. To further confirm our finding genome widely, S2 cells were treated with either β-gal dsRNA (as a control) or GW182 dsRNA for 3 days and total RNA was extracted and sequenced after ribosome depletion. By comparing the expression level of both circRNAs and linear mRNAs between controls and GW182 depleted samples, we confirmed that GW182 depletion led to accumulation circRNAs but not their parental linear mRNAs, indicating that GW182 may play an import role in the degradation of circRNAs.

625. Oxaliplatin resistance is enhanced by saracatinib via upregulation of ABCG1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Background:Oxaliplatin-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) paracrine signaling, and the IGF1 receptor can be downregulated by inhibition of Src kinases. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Src inhibition and oxaliplatin treatment exerted synergistic effects on HCC cell lines. Methods: The antitumor effects of combined treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin on proliferation were evaluated in HCC cells as well as in saracatinib- and oxaliplatin-resistant HCC cell lines using cell viability assays, plate colony formation assays, and cell cycle distribution detection. more...

(Submitter supplied) While the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly identified, few lncRNAs that control the naive state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are known. Here, we report a naive-state-associated lncRNA, lincU, which is intrinsically activated by NANOG in naive mESCs. LincU-deficient mESCs exhibit a primed-like pluripotent state and potentiate the transition from naive state to primed state, whereas ectopic lincU expression maintains mESCs in the naive state. more...

699. Pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes induce apoptosis of T lymphocytes through the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most lethal malignancy, which is characterized by poor immunogenicity. Pancreatic cancer cells take various strategies to suppress host immune response, evade immune defenses, and facilitate tumor growth and development. As a mode of long-range intercellular communication, cancer-derived exosomes contribute to the impairment of the immune system. However, the mechanisms that induce changes in the activities of signal transduction pathways in immune cells, which are influenced by tumor-derived exosomes, are poorly understood. more...

(Submitter supplied) Large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play widespread roles in epigenetic regulation during multiple differentiation processes, but little is known about their mode of action in cardiac differentiation. Here, we identified the key roles of a lincRNA, termed linc1405, in modulating the core network of cardiac differentiation by functionally interacting with Eomes. Chromatin- and RNA- immunoprecipitation assays showed that exon2 of linc1405 physically mediates a complex consisting of Eomes, Trithorax group (TrxG) subunit WDR5, and histone acetyltransferase GCN5 binding at the enhancer region of Mesp1 gene and activates its expression during cardiac mesoderm specification of embryonic stem cells. more...

712. Hepatic loss of Lis1 leads to fatty liver and predisposes to tumorigenesis in mice
(Submitter supplied) We found that genetic deletion of Lis1 (also known as Pafah1b1) in mouse liver led to increased lipid accumulation and inflammation in the liver. Further analysis revealed that loss of Lis1 led to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduced triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) diminished lipid accumulation in the Lis1 defecient hepatocytes. In addition, Golgi was disorganized in Lis1 deficient livers. more...

728. 3D genome of multiple myeloma reveals spatial genome disorganization associated with copy number variations
(Submitter supplied) Hi-C technique has been widely applied to study the three-dimensional architecture of the whole genome. Genome structures such as compartment A/B, TAD (topologically associated domain) and chromatin loops can be identified from Hi-C data in both normal cells of human and other species, and are found to be associated with features such as epigenetic markers, DNA-binding proteins and gene expression. But such technique had been rarely used in cancer studies. Here we used Hi-C to study the aneuploid cancer genomic architecture in multiple myeloma cells. Our results indicate that Hi-C interaction matrix of cancer cells is affected by CNVs and should be adjusted for copy number. After correcting this CNV bias, we found a significant overlapping between the boundaries of CNV blocks and boundaries of TADs, which suggests that TAD boundaries are fragile sites for CNV breakpoints. In addition, the compartment A/B switching is associated with differential gene expression, from which we found important genes that are related with multiple myeloma. We build a 3D structure model of the aneuploidy genome and found that there are great changes both in the whole genome spatial interactome and local chromosome territories. In summary, our research builds the first 3D genome interaction maps of multiple myeloma and the first time notice this CNV-driven bias in Hi-C studies, which may deepen our understanding of changes in cancer 3D genome.

762. Comparison of Wild type and Pofut1-deleted skeletal muscle
(Submitter supplied) Pofut1 is an essential gene that glycosylates proteins containing EGF-like repeats, including Notch Receptors (NotchRs).  Work in mice and in Drosophila has shown that O-fucosylation by Pofut1 is required for NotchR ligands to bind to and activate NotchRs.  As such, Pofut1 deletion in skeletal myofibers allows for an analysis of potential functions and molecular changes of Pofut1 in skeletal muscle that derive from its expression in skeletal myofibers. more...

770. Transcriptome Analysis Reveals a Comprehensive Regulatory Network Involved in the Zebrafish Model of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia from RPL5 Deficiency [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we generated a zebrafish model of DBA with RPL5 morphants and implemented high-throughput RNA-seq and miRNA-seq to identify key genes, lncRNAs, and miRNAs during zebrafish development and hematopoiesis. We found that RPL5 is required for both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis processes that are partially mediated by the P53 pathway. Several genes such as cirh1a, noc2l, tars, and nol6 and miRNAs such as dre-miR-10a*, dre-miR-722, dre-miR-737, and dre-miR-142a-3p were significantly deregulated, and these changes may play a crucial role in hematopoiesis, ribosome biogenesis and development process. more...

783. DDX5-deficient affect cell fate decision by regulating lineage specific genes and polycomb repressive complexes [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in a wide variety of regulatory pathways in mammalian cells. Here, we report that the DEAD-box RBP DDX5 (also known as p68) inhibits induced pluripotency by negatively regulating the expression and function of a non-canonical polycomb complex 1 (PRC1) subunit, RYBP, by modulating microRNA-125b processing. DDX5 loss-of-function, both during reprogramming and the somatic to pluripotent transition, and also in the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, results in the suppression of lineage-specific genes via an RYBP-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2A at K119 (H2AK119ub1). more...

819. A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. more...

839. A grapevine anthocyanin acyltransferase, transcriptionally regulated by VvMYBA, can produce most acylated anthocyanins present in grape skins
(Submitter supplied) Anthocyanins are flavonoid compounds responsible for red/purple colours in the leaves, fruit and flowers of many plant species. They are produced through a multistep pathway which is controlled by MYB transcription factors. VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and are non-functional in white grapevine cultivars. In this study, transgenic grapevines with altered VvMYBA gene expression were developed, and transcript analysis was carried out on berries using a microarray technique. more...

849. Complexity and Specificity of the Neutrophil Transcriptome in Diverse Inflammatory States
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils, cells generally regarded as nonspecific in their functions and responses.  We studied distinct human disease phenotypes and found that, at the gene, gene isoform, and miRNA level, neutrophils exhibit considerable specificity in their transcriptomes.  These findings were particularly striking for isoform usage.  Thus, even cells whose responses are considered non-specific show tailoring of their transcriptional repertoire toward specific physiologic or pathologic contexts. more...

919. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

The deletion of the pthA4 gene reduced the virulence of Xcc306, and eliminated pustule formation. The gene expression changes after inoculation of these two strains represent PthA4-mediated molecular events in a susceptible reaction.

985. Histone H2B ubiquitylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation prevent ectopic silencing of euchromatic loci important for the cellular response to heat
(Submitter supplied) In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ubiquitylation of histone H2B signals methylation of histone H3 at lysine residues 4 (K4) and 79. These modifications occur at active genes but are believed to stabilize silent chromatin by limiting movement of silencing proteins away from heterochromatin domains. In the course of studying atypical phenotypes associated with loss of H2B ubiquitylation/H3K4 methylation, we discovered that these modifications are also required for cell wall integrity at high temperatures. more...

1016. Transcriptional Characterization of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Endothelial Cells
(Submitter supplied) Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) has the potential to provide an unlimited source of cells for novel transplantation therapies of ischemic diseases by supporting angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. In this study, we developed an extracellular matrix culture system for increasing endothelial differentiation and free from contaminating animal cells. We investigated the transcriptional changes that occur during endothelial differentiation of hESCs using whole genome microarray, and compared to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). more...

1017. Systematic planning of genome-scale experiments in poorly studied species.
(Submitter supplied) Genome-scale datasets have been used extensively in model organisms to screen for specific candidates or to predict functions for uncharacterized genes. However, despite the availability of extensive knowledge in model organisms, the planning of genome-scale experiments in poorly studied species is still based on the intuition of experts or heuristic trials. We propose that computational and systematic approaches can be applied to drive the experiment planning process in poorly studied species based on available data and knowledge in closely related model organisms. more...
