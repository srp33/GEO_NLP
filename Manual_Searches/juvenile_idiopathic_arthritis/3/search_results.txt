(Submitter supplied) Precision medicine's potential to transform complex autoimmune-disease treatment is often challenged by limited data availability and inadequate sample size when compared to the number of molecular features found in high-throughput multi-omics datasets. Addressing this issue, the novel framework PRoBeNet (Predictive Response Biomarkers using Network medicine) was developed. ProBeNet operates under the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of a drug propagates through a protein–protein interaction network to reverse disease states. more...

(Submitter supplied) CD69+CD103+ tissue-resident memory T-cells (TRM) are increasingly recognised as important drivers of inflammation. To decipher their potential role in inflammatory arthritis, we applied single cell, high-dimensional profiling (CyTOF and scRNAseq) to T-cells isolated from the joint of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We identified three broad groups of synovial CD8+ TRM cells: cytotoxic and Treg-like TRM cells were present in the inflamed joints of patients with both PsA and RA, while CD161+CXCR6+ type 17-like TRM cells with a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (IL-17A+TNFa+IFNg+) and a distinct transcriptomic signature and a polyclonal, but distinct TCR repertoire, were specifically enriched in the inflamed joints of patients with PsA. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recent studies have identified B cells inhibit bone formation in rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing osteoblast differentiation. However, it remains unknown how B cells participate in the healing of fractures. Here we find that B cells decrease significantly during fracture healing and returned to normal levels after that by single-cell profiling. Furthermore, we found that exosomes derived from B cells inhibited the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro. more...

213. The transcriptomic profile of monocytes from patients with Sjögren’s Syndrome is associated with inflammatory parameters and is mimicked by circulating mediators
(Submitter supplied) Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by infiltration of the exocrine glands and prominent B cell hyperactivity. Considering the key role of monocytes in promoting B cell hyperactivity, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of CD14+ monocytes from patients with pSS, non-Sjögren’s sicca (nSS), and healthy controls (HC). We demonstrated that the transcriptomic profile of pSS patients is enriched in intermediate and non-classical monocyte profiles, and confirmed the increased frequency of non-classical monocytes in pSS patients by flow-cytometry analysis. more...

340. Osteoarthritis RNA Sequencing from ground cartilage samples
(Submitter supplied) Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease with the typifying feature being the progressive degradation of articular cartilage during disease progression. In this study we used whole transcriptome RNA-seq as a tool to compare gene expression changes between age-matched osteoarthritic human hip OA cartilage (n=10) compared to control (neck of femur fracture) cartilage (n=6) [GSE107308]. All cartilage was from patients undergoing acetabulofemoral joint replacement. Cartilage RNA was isolated from cartilage within 2 hr of joint replacement surgery, mRNA was polyA purified and transcript expression was analysed using 78-base paired-end sequencing generating on average 28 million reads/sample sequencing.  The data shows excellent correlation with our previous microarray data but identifies significantly more differentially expressed transcripts plus novel transcript variants, several of which have been validated by real-time qPCR. Our work sheds further light on chondrocyte transcriptome expression and highlights gene expression changes and novel transcripts potentially important in osteoarthritis progression

346. RORγt inhibition selectively targets IL-17 producing human iNKT and γδ-T cells enriched in Spondyloarthritis while preserving IL-22 responses
(Submitter supplied) Dysregulated IL-23/IL-17 responses have been linked to psoriatic arthritis and other forms of spondyloarthritides (SpA). RORγt, the key Thelper17 (Th17) cell transcriptional regulator, is also expressed by subsets of innate-like T cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) and γδ-T cells, but how they contribute to disorders such as SpA is still unclear. Here we describe the presence of particular RORγt+T-betloPLZF- iNKT and γδ-hi T cell subsets in healthy peripheral blood. more...

380. EOMES-expressing CD4+ T cells are increased in PTPN22 (1858T) risk allele carriers
(Submitter supplied) The presence of the PTPN22 risk variant (1858T) is associated to several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite a number of studies exploring the function of PTPN22 in T cells, the exact impact of the PTPN22 risk variant on T cell function in humans is still unclear. In this study, using RNA sequencing, we show that, upon TCR-activation, naïve CD4+ T cells carrying two PTPN22 risk alleles overexpress a limited number of genes including CFLAR and 4-1BB important for cytotoxic T cell differentiation. more...

384. Identification of genes regulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblasts-like synoviocytes (RA FLS)
(Submitter supplied) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease involving primarily the synovial membranes and articular structures of multiple joints. A hallmark of RA is the pseudo-tumoral expansion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), as these cells invade and finally destroy the joint structure. RA FLS have been therefore proposed as a therapeutic target.  > TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been described as a pro-apoptotic factor on malignant cells. more...

438. Using AmpliSeq we have performed quantitative analysis of 20,803 genes in Negative control precursor-miR (NC-Pre-miR) and pre-miR-17 transfected Rheumatoid arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts (RASFs)
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: The goals of this study are to determine the effect of microRNA-17 overexpression on 20,803 human genes in RASFs using Ion ProtonTM System platform. Human RASFs from two RA patients were transfected with pre-miR-17 or NC-pre-miR for 48 h and total RNA was prepared using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bio analyzer (Santa Clara, CA). 10 ng of high quality RNA was used to make cDNA for amplification with the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).  The cDNA was subjected to 12 cycles of amplification with panel primers and barcoded with adapters as recommended.  Resulting sequencing libraries were quantified by qPCR using SYBR FAST master mix from KapaBiosystems (Wilmington, MA).  Sets of eight libraries were balanced, pooled and sequencing beads produced on an Ion Chef.  Sequencing was performed on an Ion P1 semi-conductor sequencing chip using an Ion Proton™ System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). Data was collected and primary analysis performed using Torrent Suite software version 5.0.3. Reads were mapped to the panel and expression values determined. R Software version R-3.2.3 was used to generate heatmap. Among the panel of 20,803 genes, the expression of 15,067 genes as shown in the representative heat map was observed in pre-miR-17 and NC-pre-miR transfected RASFs. A total of 664 significantly modulated genes (301 upregulated and 363 downregulated) using Student ‘t’ test were further utilized for the IPA analysis. The result of IPA predicted the protein ubiquitin pathway as a major canonical pathway affected by the differentially regulated genes. Interestingly, IPA analysis generated an interactome that showed connectivity among various ubiquitin ligases, NF-ԟB family, AP-1/cJun, 20S and 26S proteasome system. Conclusion: Our results clearly shows the major pathways affected by miR-17 overexpression in RASFs were Protein ubiquitination related.

465. Transcriptome response to 4h IL-1b stimulation of primary chondrocytes
(Submitter supplied) Using RNA sequencing (Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 sequencer) we report the transcriptome profile of primary human chondrocytes isolated from patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and the transcriptome response of these cells to 4h stimulation with IL-1β (1ng/ml).  In total, 983 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified, which included 642 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 124 antisense and pseudogenes.  Less than 4% of the identified lncRNAs overlapped with putative eRNAs regions, and visual inspection showed that they were uni-directional and multi-exonic.  Upon  IL-1β stimulation 499 protein-coding genes were differentially expressed, and 158 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, including 92 lincRNAs, 13 antisense and 18 psudogenes.  This study demonstrates that IL-1β induces a rapid and widespread change in the transcriptome of the primary human OA chondrocyte.

468. Complexity and Specificity of the Neutrophil Transcriptome in Diverse Inflammatory States
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils, cells generally regarded as nonspecific in their functions and responses.  We studied distinct human disease phenotypes and found that, at the gene, gene isoform, and miRNA level, neutrophils exhibit considerable specificity in their transcriptomes.  These findings were particularly striking for isoform usage.  Thus, even cells whose responses are considered non-specific show tailoring of their transcriptional repertoire toward specific physiologic or pathologic contexts. more...

488. Genome-wide expression analysis demonstrates a dominant role of TLR4 for activation of human phagocytes by the alarmin MRP8
(Submitter supplied) The alarmins myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8 and MRP14 are the dominant cytoplasmic proteins in phagocytes. After release by activated phagocytes extracellular MRP8/MRP14 complexes promote inflammation in many diseases, including infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. As receptors for the pro-inflammatory effects of human MRP8, the active component of the MRP8/MRP14-complex, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and the multi-ligand receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) are controversial discussed. more...

600. Chondrogenic differentiation potential of OA chondrocytes and their use in autologous chondrocyte transplantation
(Submitter supplied) Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is a routine technique to regenerate focal cartilage lesions. However, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) are lacking an appropriate long-lasting treatment alternative, partly since it is not known if chondrocytes from OA patients have the same chondrogenic differentiation potential as chondrocytes from donors not affected by OA. Articular chondrocytes from patients with OA undergoing total knee replacement (Mankin Score >3, Ahlbäck Score >2) and from patients undergoing ACT, here referred to as normal donors (ND), were isolated applying protocols used for ACT. more...

Gene expression profiles were obtained for 131 peripheral blood samples from pediatric patients with acute infections caused by influenza A virus, Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) or Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria. more...

638. Identification of genes specifically over-expressed in lupus CD4 T and B cells
(Submitter supplied) Objective: Gene expression studies performed on PBMC from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients provided strong evidence of a type I interferon signature, underscoring the potential role of these cytokines in the physiopathology of SLE. In this work, we performed microarray analyses of differential gene expression using purified CD4 T and B cells sorted from SLE PBMC. In order to discriminate genes specific to SLE from those induced by inflammatory responses in general, control samples were obtained not only from healthy individuals but also from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. more...

639. Arthritis_RA_OA_VNS
(Submitter supplied) Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) represents a rare group of lesions with morphological features suggesting an inflammatory as well as a neoplastic nature. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue and a tumor-like proliferation (TLP) of synovial stroma cells. Osteoarthritis (OA) shows modest inflammatory infiltrates and no TLP. All three diseases result in a progressive destruction of affected joints and remain a diagnostic difficulty because of nonspecific symptoms. more...

640. B27 modulation of LPS response
(Submitter supplied) Objectives How HLA-B27 contributes towards arthritis susceptibility is still unclear, but effects on the response to bacteria unrelated to the classical antigen presenting role of B27 have been suggested. This study investigated whether HLA-B27 modulates the innate response to LPS, a component shared between all Gram –ve bacteria that can trigger reactive arthritis. Methods Pools of U937 transfectants expressing either HLA-B27, HLA-A2, or the expression  plasmid alone were differentiated with PMA and stimulated with LPS. more...

642. Mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine in rheumatic diseases
(Submitter supplied) Objective. Colchicine is an alkaloid that is used to alleviate acute gout and to prevent acute attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). However, it is not beneficial when given during the occurrence of an acute episode of FMF. It is believed that colchicine exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through direct interaction with microtubules. We aim to study the molecular basis of colchicine action by analysing the effect of this drug on global gene expression of HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell line) cells. more...
