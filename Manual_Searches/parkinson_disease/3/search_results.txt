(Submitter supplied) Aging is associated with cell senescence and is the major risk factor for AD. We characterized premature cell senescence in post mortem brains from non-diseased controls (NDC) and donors with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and single nuclear RNA (snRNA) sequencing (>200,000 nuclei). We found increases in numbers of glia immunostaining for galactosidase beta (>4-fold) and p16INK4A (up to 2-fold) with AD relative to NDC. more...

4. Engrailed 1 deficiency induces changes in ciliogenesis during human neuronal differentiation
(Submitter supplied) A key pathological feature of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DAns) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Considering the major role of EN1 in the development and maintenance of these DAns and the implications from En1 mouse models, it is highly interesting to study the molecular and protective effect of EN1 also in a human cellular model. Therefore, we generated EN1 knock-out (ko) human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) lines and analyzed these during neuronal differentiation. more...

5. Unravelling cell type specific response to Parkinson’s Disease at single cell resolution
(Submitter supplied) Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The pathological hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of aggregated α-synuclein, primarily in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathology in different cell types is not currently understood. Here, we present a single nuclei transcriptomic analysis of human post-mortem in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) tissue from 15 sporadic Parkinson’s Disease (PD) cases and 14 Controls. more...

(Submitter supplied) Several mutations that cause Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been identified over the past decade. These account for 15-25% of PD cases; the rest of the cases are considered sporadic. Currently, it is accepted that PD is not a single monolithic disease but rather a constellation of diseases with some common phenotypes. While rodent models exist for some of the PD-causing mutations, research on the sporadic forms of PD is lagging due to a lack of cellular models. more...

20. LRRK2 G2019S variant triggers transcriptional changes in Parkinson’s disease human myeloid cells under pro-inflammatory environment
(Submitter supplied) The G2019S mutation in the LRRk2 gene is a major Parkinson’s disease risk factor. We studied its effect on microglial activity and found that it remains inactive under normal conditions but strongly affects gene regulation when exposed to inflammation such as LPS and IFNg. The mutation increases lipid metabolism and phagolysosomal genes in microglia, enhancing their ability to clear myelin debris. It also disrupts cell cycle genes, decreasing proliferation and E2F4 regular.These findings reveal G2019S’s significant impact on myeloid cell gene activity during inflammation, highlighting lipid imbalance as a key factor in functional disruptions.

36. scRNAseq analysis of four populations sorted from midbrain organoids using Flow cytometry
(Submitter supplied) Midbrain organoid derived from human induced pluriopotent stem cells a new model of Parkinson's Disease.  Organ specific organoids can be used to model many diseases, however little is know about these models.  We created a flow cytometry workflow to identify cell types in midbrain organoids.  We then selected four populations and sorted these populations: Neurons1(CD24++), Neurons2(CD56++), Astrocytes and Radial Glia, using FACS and the antibody intensity gates defined by our workflow. more...

68. Transcriptomic alterations in fibroblast from parkinson's disease patients at high and low glucose levels
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that molecular pathways in a cell model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) could be altered depending of glucose levels. We cultured fibroblasts from sporadic PD (sPD; n=4), PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations (LRRK2-PD; n=3) and healthy controls (HC; n=4) at high (25 mM) and low (5 mM) glucose and analysed the transcriptome profile by using whole RNA sequencing.   We found 1439 differentially expressed transcripts (DET) comparing HC with overall PD cases. These genes are related with THE gene ontology terms cytosqueleton, cell adhesion, protein translation and ribosomes, mitochondrial electron transport between others, when cultured at 25 mM of glucose. However, at 5 mM there are virtually no gene expression changes in PD compared to controls. When compared between 5 and 25 mM condition separately for each group HC and PD, we found 1482 DET in controls, and 3381 in PD cases, but only found altered significant gene ontology terms in PD.  These findings suggest that high glucose levels cause specific molecular changes in fibroblasts which is exacerbated in PD, potentially leading to non adaptive changes. This work emphasizes the importance of energetic balance in PD and the need of further research about the role of glucose levels in clinical studies.  .

70. Mutant glucocerebrosidase impairs alpha-synuclein degradation by blockade of chaperone-mediated autophagy
(Submitter supplied) The most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease (PD) are a set of heterozygous mutant (MT) alleles of the GBA1 gene that encodes Beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), an enzyme normally trafficked through the ER/ Golgi apparatus to the lysosomal lumen. We found that half of the GCase in lysosomes from post-mortem human GBA-PD brains was present on the lysosomal surface, and that this mislocalization depends on a pentapeptide motif in GCase used to target cytosolic protein for degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). more...

75. Transcriptomic alterations in fibroblast from parkinson's disease patients at high glucose levels
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that molecular pathways in a cell model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) could be altered depending of glucose levels. We cultured fibroblasts from sporadic PD (sPD; n=4), PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations (LRRK2-PD; n=3) and healthy controls (HC; n=4) at high (25 mM) and low (5 mM) glucose and analysed the transcriptome profile by using whole RNA sequencing.   We found 1439 differentially expressed transcripts (DET) comparing HC with overall PD cases. These genes are related with THE gene ontology terms cytosqueleton, cell adhesion, protein translation and ribosomes, mitochondrial electron transport between others, when cultured at 25 mM of glucose. However, at 5 mM there are virtually no gene expression changes in PD compared to controls. When compared between 5 and 25 mM condition separately for each group HC and PD, we found 1482 DET in controls, and 3381 in PD cases, but only found altered significant gene ontology terms in PD.  These findings suggest that high glucose levels cause specific molecular changes in fibroblasts which is exacerbated in PD, potentially leading to non adaptive changes. This work emphasizes the importance of energetic balance in PD and the need of further research about the role of glucose levels in clinical studies.

In concert with PINK1, Parkin regulates the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria via lysosomes. In response, new mitochondria are generated through an interplay of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Mouse and overexpression models suggests that Parkin also influences these processes, both in the nuclear cascade and at the level of the mitochondrial genome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction for which there is an unmet need for better treatment options. Although oxidative stress is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, notably PD, there is currently no efficient therapeutic strategy able to tackle this system-wide pathophysiological process. Based on our previous observations of the potent antioxidant and neuroprotective activity of SELENOT, a vital thioredoxin-like selenoprotein, we designed the small peptide PSELT from its redox active site in order to determine its potential polyfunctional activity in PD models. more...

110. Epigenetic inactivation of the autophagy-lysosomal system in the Parkinson’s disease appendix (2: PD_RNASeq)
(Submitter supplied) The gastrointestinal tract may be a site of origin for α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), and an abundance of aggregated α-syn has recently been demonstrated in both the healthy and PD appendix. However, the molecular changes that enable gut α-syn aggregates to contribute to the development and progression of PD remain unclear. Here, our deep-sequencing of DNA methylation changes at 521 autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) genes in the human appendix and brain in PD and healthy controls indicates a pattern of widespread hypermethylation in the PD appendix that is recapitulated in the PD brain. more...

111. Association of common genetic variation with Parkinson’s disease is driven by microglial modulation of Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 expression
(Submitter supplied) Previous studies have shown that non-coding genetic variation in the 5’ region of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene contributes to Parkinson's disease risk and influences LRRK2 expression, with the risk allele associated with increased expression of LRRK2. To interrogate the biological basis of this expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), we used single nuclei RNA sequencing of human frontal cortex from donors with known LRRK2 risk genotypes to show that the eQTL propagates via microglia, despite robust expression of LRRK2 in other cell types. more...

132. Hemispheric asymmetry in the human brain and in Parkinson’s disease is linked to divergent epigenetic patterns in neurons
(Submitter supplied) Background Hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal processes is a fundamental feature of the human brain and drives symptom lateralization in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its molecular determinants are unknown. Here, we identify divergent epigenetic patterns involved in hemispheric asymmetry by profiling DNA methylation in isolated prefrontal cortex neurons from control and PD brain hemispheres. DNA methylation is fine-mapped at enhancers and promoters, genome-wide, by targeted bisulfite sequencing in two independent sample cohorts. more...

Blood gene expression in male Latino farmworkers, where chronic pesticide exposure is occupational, was compared to blood gene expression in age and gender matched Latino manual workers. We identified an expression signature for farmwork, differential expression in genes that correlated with levels of urinary pesticide metabolites, alterations in axonal guidance pathways and statistical models that link farmworker differential expression to Parkinson's disease.

144. Distinct Expression Profiles of long non-coding RNAs and messenger RNAs in circulating leukocytes of Parkinson’s disease
(Submitter supplied) The molecular mechanism underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), an increasingly common neurodegenerative disease, remains unclear. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays essential roles in gene expression and human disease. We hypothesize that lncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. We profiled the expression of lncRNA in circulating leukocytes of 5 PD patients and 5 healthy controls using microarray.

Large expansions in C9orf72 (100s-1000s of units) are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). However, whether intermediate expansions also contribute to neurodegenerative disease is not well understood. Several studies have identified intermediate repeats in Parkinson’s disease patients, but the association was not found in autopsy confirmed cases. more...

The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is one of the most common known causes of familial PD. To characterize its effect on astrocytes, we developed a protocol to produce midbrain-patterned astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from PD LRRK2 G2019S patients and healthy controls. more...

169. Genome-wide expression profiling of the LRRK2-G2019S mutation in hNES cells
(Submitter supplied) Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a neuro-developmental component with multiple genetic predispositions. The most prevalent mutation, LRRK2-G2019S is linked to familial and sporadic PD. Based on the multiple origins of PD and the incomplete penetrance of LRRK2-G2019S, we hypothesize that modifiers in the patient genetic background act as susceptibility factors for developing PD. To assess the developmental component of LRRK2-G2019S pathogenesis, we used 19 human iPSC-derived neuroepithelial stem cell lines (NESCs). more...

171. Parkinson’s Disease Genetic Risk in a Midbrain Neuronal Cell Line
(Submitter supplied) In genome-wide association studies of complex diseases, many risk polymorphisms are found to lie in non-coding DNA and likely confer risk through allele-dependent differences in gene regulatory elements. However, because distal regulatory elements can alter gene expression at various distances on linear DNA, the identity of relevant genes is unknown for most risk loci. In Parkinson’s disease, at least some genetic risk is likely intrinsic to a neuronal subpopulation of cells in the brain regions affected. more...

218. Human iPSC-based Modeling of Late-Onset Disease using Progerin-induced Aging
(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) sets their identity back to an embryonic age. This presents a fundamental hurdle for modeling late-onset disorders using iPSC-derived cells. We therefore developed a strategy to induce age-like features in multiple iPSC-derived lineages and tested its impact on modeling Parkinson’s disease (PD). We first describe markers that predict fibroblast donor age and observed the loss of these age-related markers following iPSC induction and re-differentiation into fibroblasts. more...

236. The transcription factor nurr1 exerts concentration-dependent effects on target genes mediating distinct biological processes
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor nurr1 plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of neurotransmitter phenotype in midbrain dopamine neurons. Conversely, decreased nurr1 expression is associated with a number of dopamine-related CNS disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and drug addiction. In order to better understand the nature of nurr1-responsive genes and their potential roles in dopamine neuron differentiation and survival, we used a neural cellular background in which to generate a number of stable clonal lines with graded nurr1 gene expression that approximated that seen in DA cell-rich human substantia nigra. more...

237. Microarray expression analysis in idiopathic and LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease
(Submitter supplied) LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We performed a whole-genome RNA profiling of putamen tissue from idiopathic PD (IPD), LRRK2-associated PD (G2019S mutation), neurologically healthy controls and one asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carrier, by using the Genechip Human Exon 1.0-ST Array. The differentially expressed genes found in IPD revealed an alteration of biological pathways related to long term potentiation (LTP), GABA receptor signalling, and calcium signalling pathways, among others. more...

238. Midbrain floor plate dopamine neurons from human ESCs efficiently engraft in murine and primate models of PD
(Submitter supplied) Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine. Directed differentiation of hPSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons has been achieved.  However the effective use of hPSCs for cell therapy has lagged far behind. While mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson’s disease, DA neurons derived from human PSCs generally display poor in vivo performance. more...

244. Gene expression changes across multiple regions of the Parkinson’s disease brain
(Submitter supplied) We have used microarrays to analyze gene expression in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We used four different brain regions, including two that are relatively affected in PD (striatum and cortex) and two that are relatively spared (cerebellum and medulla). We show that while differences between brain regions are strong, expression profile differences between PD and controls are much more modest and that genome-wide significant differences are restricted to the striatum and cerebral cortex.

We also demonstrated that this cell type differentiates into neural cells and improves locomotor behavior after transplantation in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease. Yet, next to nothing is known about their specific stemness characteristics. We therefore devised a study aiming to compare olfactory lamina propria stem cells from 4 individuals to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 4 age- and gendermatched individuals. more...

(Submitter supplied) DJ-1 is an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase that may act as a redox-dependent chaperone and a regulator of transcription. To explore DJ-1-mediated transcriptional control in Parkinson’s disease (PD), we generated human neuroblastoma cells with inducible knock-down of DJ-1 expression. We then used functional genomic techniques to identify novel pathways dysregulated by loss of DJ-1 function. Using microarray gene expression profiling, we found that DJ-1 silencing alters the expression of 26 genes, with 10 down-regulated and 16 up-regulated transcripts. more...

278. Parkinson's disease vs. controls, whole blood
(Submitter supplied) Parkinson’s disease (PD) progresses relentlessly and affects five million people worldwide. Laboratory tests for PD are critically needed for developing treatments designed to slow or prevent progression of the disease. We performed a transcriptome-wide scan in 105 individuals to interrogate the molecular processes perturbed in cellular blood of patients with early-stage PD. The molecular marker here identified is strongly associated with risk of PD in 66 samples of the training set (third tertile cross-validated odds ratio of 5.7 {P for trend 0.005}). more...

280. Microarray Studies in the Laser Capture Microdissected SNc after a Single Administration of MPTP in Common Marmosets
(Submitter supplied) We have previously detected cyclin D1-initiated and p53-related (PERP; p53 apoptosis-associated target) cell death in a striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated Parkinsonian mouse model by adaptor-tagged competitive PCR (ATAC-PCR) (Synapse 51, 279-286, 2004). In order to establish the mechanism of dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson’s disease, various Parkinsonian animal models should be studied. more...

281. Greene-5P01NS017771-220003
(Submitter supplied) Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure.  The cause of PD symptoms is loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, but it is not known why these neurons die.  Pesticide exposure is epidemiologically associated with PD, and administration of the organic pesticide rotenone to rats recapitulates most of the behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological findings in PD, including specific death of dopamine neurons. more...
