(Submitter supplied) Typical multiomics studies employ separate methods for DNA, RNA, and protein sample preparation, which is labor intensive, costly, and prone to sampling bias. We describe a method for preparing high-quality, sequencing-ready DNA and RNA, and either intact proteins or mass-spectrometry-ready peptides for whole proteome analysis from a single sample. This method utilizes a reversible protein tagging scheme to covalently link all proteins in a lysate to a bead-based matrix and nucleic acid precipitation and selective solubilization to yield separate pools of protein and nucleic acids. more...

3. A continuous ferroptosis-to-apoptosis landscape identifies ferroptosis biomarkers and repressors for cancer therapy
(Submitter supplied) Ferroptosis, a cell death pathway driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in several human diseases including cancer. Although ferroptosis is entwined with apoptosis, it currently has no   characteristic biomarkers or gene signature. In this project we established a continuous phenotypic gradient between ferroptosis and apoptosis and coupled it to transcriptomic and metabolomic landscapes. Omics and mechanistic studies revealed that ferroptosis was associated with enhanced MITF activity, lysosomal function, glutaminolysis, TCA cycle, and activation of ATF4, while its transition into apoptosis was attributed to enhanced ER-stress, ATF4/CHOP switch and PE/PC metabolic shift. more...

13. Connective Tissue Growth Factor, a Potential Prognostic Marker of Triple Negative Breast Cancer treatment
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient with high level of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) show poor survival and prognosis. Identification of novel target contributes to the development of TNBC treatment. Kahweol, a coffee diterpene molecule, is a natural compound with pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic, and apoptotic effect in several cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of CTGF expression level in TNBC treatment. Experiments were performed on MDA-MB 231, a TNBC cell line. Firstly, functional annotation and gene set enrichment analysis found that the CTGF involves in migratory pathways in TNBC treatment. We also investigated that kahweol regulates CTGF expression and functions as antitumor compound resulting in inhibition of cell migration and colony formation in TNBC. Next, CTGF knockdown synergically suppressed cell motility with kahweol. Migratory ability and colony conformation were also performed in vitro to confirm the results from functional annotation assay. Overall, our results suggest that CTGF is a potential target as a prognostic marker predicting the prognosis of TNBC treatment, and kahweol is a potential antitumor compound to regulate CTGF expression for TNBC.

Three (or Two) biological replicates were assigned for each group and in total 6 groups were prepared for these RNA seq libraries. We mapped about 20 million reads per sample to hg38 human reference genome, and counted and normalized each reads number and identified the differentially expressed genes.

35. LOXL2-mediated chromatin compaction is required to maintain the oncogenic properties of triple-negative breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Oxidation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4ox) is catalyzed by lysyl oxidase–like 2 (LOXL2). This histone modification is enriched in heterochromatin in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and has been linked to the maintenance of compacted chromatin. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this maintenance is still unknown. Here we show that LOXL2 interacts with RUVBL1, RUVBL2, BAF53, and DMAP1, a complex involved in the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z. more...

36. RAGE/SNAIL signaling drives Epithelial-Mesenchymal plasticity in metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Epithelial-Mesenchymal plasticity plays a fundamental role both in embryogenesis and in tumor cell dissemination during tumor progression. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a driver of cell plasticity in fibrotic diseases; however, its role and molecular mechanism in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that RAGE signaling maintains the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive TNBC cells by enforcing the expression of SNAIL. more...

43. Nuclear export of circular RNA
(Submitter supplied) Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which can function as regulators of gene expression, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here, we uncover a pathway specific for nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, Exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter, CRM1, selectively increases nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. more...

(Submitter supplied) Aurora kinase inhibitors such as alisertib can destabilize MYC-family oncoproteins and have demonstrated compelling anti-tumor efficacy. In this study, we report 6K465, a novel pyrimidine-based Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor that reduces levels of c-MYC and N-MYC oncoproteins more potently than alisertib. In an analysis of the antiproliferative effect of 6K465, the sensitivities of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer (BC) cell lines to 6K465 were strongly associated with the protein levels of c-MYC and/or N-MYC. more...

119. Inhibitory effect of VNLG-152R on breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231
(Submitter supplied) In previous studies, our research demonstrated that VNLG-152R exhibits inhibitory effects on Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells both in vitro and in vivo. The TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with VNLG-152R. A total of 337 genes were differentially expressed when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 μM VNLG-152R for 24h; 259 genes were upregulated and 78 downregulated. Through proteome analyses, we discovered that VNLG-152R upregulates the expression of E3 ligase Synoviolin 1 (SYVN1), also called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) in TNBC cells. more...

121. A first-in-class fully modified version of miR-34a with outstanding stability, activity, and anti-tumor efficacy
(Submitter supplied) Altered by defects in p53, epigenetic silencing, and genomic loss, the microRNA miR-34a represents one of the most clinically relevant tumor-suppressive microRNAs. Without question, a striking number of patients with cancer would benefit from miR-34a replacement, if poor miR-34a stability, non-specific delivery, and delivery-associated toxicity could be overcome. Here, we highlight a fully modified version of miR-34a (FM-miR-34a) that overcomes these hurdles when conjugated to a synthetically simplistic ligand. more...

127. Role of EGR1 in vasculogenic mimicry of MDA-MB-231 cells
(Submitter supplied) Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is an intriguing phenomenon observed in tumor masses, in which cancer cells organize themselves into capillary-like channels that closely resemble the structure and function of blood vessels. Although VM is believed to contribute to alternative tumor vascularization, the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes remain poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the role of Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) in regulating VM in aggressive cancer cells, specifically MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.

(Submitter supplied) Sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is an important component of innate immunity. Proteins like PKR and MDA5 recognize dsRNA and activate various pathways to fight viral infection. In addition to viral dsRNA, many endogenous RNAs containing double-stranded regions can be misrecognized as immunogenic. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, specifically its p150 isoform, has been shown to suppress activation of PKR and MDA5 through its A-to-I editing activity. more...

138. The tumor suppressive role of ANCO1 in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) To understand the impact of ANCO1 reduction on gene expressions, we performed RNA-seq experiments in shANCO1 and shCTRL MCF10A and MCFDCIS cells  in 2D and 3D culture. We report ANCO1 knockdown leads to altered gene expression profiles. Enriched gene sets including chr1q21.3 and mTORC1 signaling may be responsible for phenotypical changes in shANCO1 cell lines.

140. Flt3L therapy induces a Treg‐promoting cDC1 state in triple‐negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are at the forefront of activating the immune system to mount an anti‐tumor immune response. Flt3L is a cytokine required for DC development that can increase DC abundance in the tumor when administered therapeutically. However, the impact of Flt3L on the phenotype of distinct cDC subsets in the tumor microenvironment is still largely undetermined. Here, using multi‐omic single‐cell analysis, we show that Flt3L therapy increases all cDC subsets in orthotopic E0771 triple‐negative breast cancer, but this did not result in a reduction of tumor growth. more...

148. Discovery of a Highly Potent and Selective HDAC3 and HDAC8 PROTAC Dual Degrader
(Submitter supplied) HDAC3 and HDAC8 are members of class I deacetylases involved in several biological mechanisms and represent a highly sought-after therapeutic target for drug development. It is historically challenging to develop selective deacetylase inhibitors due to their conserved catalytic domains. HDAC3 also has deacetylase-independent activity, which cannot be blocked by conventional enzymatic inhibitors. Recent advance in proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) provides an opportunity to eliminate the whole protein selectively, abolishing both enzymatic and scaffolding function. more...

158. Cancer cell non-autonomous tumor progression from chromosomal instability
(Submitter supplied) Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a driver of cancer metastasis and immune evasion. Yet, the extent to which this effect depends on the immune system remains unknown. Here we show that CIN-induced chronic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in cancer cells induces signal re-wiring downstream of STING, promoting a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment (TME). Using ContactTracing, a newly developed, validated, and benchmarked tool to infer conditionally-dependent cell-cell interactions from single cell transcriptomic data, we identify a cancer cell-derived STING-dependent ER stress response that remodels a TME replete with immune suppressive myeloid cells and dysfunctional T cells. more...

Here, we used single-cell magneto-optical capture (scMOCa) to isolate fast cells from heterogeneous breast cancer cell populations, based on their migratory ability alone. We show that captured fast cell subpopulations retain higher migration speed and focal adhesion dynamics over many generations due to a motility-related transcriptomic profile. more...

175. ACSS2 inhibitors act as metabo-immunomodulators in triple negative breast cancer [scRNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Acetate metabolism is an important metabolic pathway in many types of cancers and is primarily controlled by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA. However, the consequences of inhibiting tumor acetate metabolism on the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immunity are unknown. Herein we demonstrate that the growth of ACSS2 deficient triple negative breast cancer is severely impaired when host immunity is intact and, in many instances, ACSS2 deficient tumors are fully cleared by the immune system. more...

209. The impact of PD-1 antibody or G-CSF antibody on the immune system and the hematopoiesis of TNBC mice
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most intractable subtype of breast cancer. Inhibitors of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 have been considered as promising treatment for TNBC patients. However, only a minor subset of TNBC patients benefits from the monotherapy. An analysis of how PD-1/PD-L1 blockage affect immune activities in TNBC tumor-bearing mice could provide insights for it limitation. more...

246. Effect of endothelial-specific endorepellin expression on gene expression of breast cancer allografts in Tie2CreER;ERKi mice
(Submitter supplied) To explore the translational implications of endorepellin in breast cancer, we created a double transgenic, inducible Tie2CreER;ERKi mouse line that expresses recombinant endorepellin specifically from the endothelium. We investigated the therapeutic effects of recombinant endorepellin overexpression in an orthotopic, syngeneic breast cancer allograft mouse model. Tamoxifen-induced expression of recombinant endorepellin specifically from the endothelium in Tie2CreER;ERKi mice markedly suppressed breast cancer allograft growth, hyaluronan deposition in the tumor proper and perivascular tissues, and tumor angiogenesis.

283. Identification of Src Family Kinases as potential therapeutic targets for chemotherapy-resistant triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains the cornerstone of treatment for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with the goal of complete eradication of disease.  However, for patients with residual disease after NAC, recurrence and mortality rates are high and identification of novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Here we quantified tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) mediated signaling networks in chemotherapy sensitive (CS) and resistant (CR) TNBC patient derived xenografts (PDX) to gain novel therapeutic insights. more...

285. Targeting IRAK2 in triple-negative breast cancer cells decreases cellular growth in vitro and delays tumor progression in murine models
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are responsible for tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. We have established primary BCSC cultures from human tumors of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subgroup of breast cancer likely driven by BCSCs. Primary BCSCs generate xenografts phenocopying the tumors of origin, representing a suitable model to investigate breast cancer targeting strategies. In the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468, we previously screened kinases whose depletion elicited a differentiation response, among which IRAK2 was identified. more...

286. Chemotherapy-induced complement signaling modulates immunosuppression and metastatic relapse in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Mortality from breast cancer is almost exclusively a result of tumor metastasis and resistance to therapy and therefore understanding the underlying mechanisms is an urgent challenge. Chemotherapy, routinely used to treat breast cancer, induces extensive tissue damage, eliciting an inflammatory response that may hinder efficacy and promote metastatic relapse. Here we show that systemic treatment with doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, following resection of a triple-negative breast tumor induced the expression of complement factors in lung fibroblasts and modulated an immunosuppressive metastatic niche that supported lung metastasis. more...

355. Comparative Characterization of 3D Chromatin Organization in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers [Hi-C]
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is malignant cancer with a high risk of recurrence. To date, the underlying 3D chromatin organizations of TNBC have remained unclear. Here, using in situ Hi-C, we characterized the 3D chromatin organizations in cells representing five distinct subtypes of breast cancer (including TNBC) and TNBC tissues, compared to normal cells/tissues. We found that the global and local 3D architectures are severely disrupted in TNBC cells. more...

356. Transcriptome analysis of Scramble control and Cdk14-sh mouse mammary basal cells
(Submitter supplied) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has become a key signaling pathway regulating mammary organogenesis and oncogenesis. However, the therapeutic methods by targeting Wnt pathway against breast cancer has been limited. To address this challenge, we investigated the function of cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), a member of Wnt signaling pathway, in mammary development and breast cancer progression. We showed that CDK14 was expressed in the mammary basal layer and elevated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). more...

366. SAM68 is a splicing regulator in triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) SAM68 is an RNA binding protein frequently up-regulated in several human cancers and its oncogenic activity has often been associated with its splicing activity. Nevertheless, the genome-wide impact of SAM68 on the transcriptome of cancer cells is still unknown. Herein,  by high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis of MDA-MB-231 SAM68-silenced cells, we uncover an extensive modulation of triple-negative breast cancer cell transcriptome by this splicing factor.

To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we mapped the genome-wide localization of endogenous macroH2A1.1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231. We demonstrate that macroH2A1.1 specifically binds to active promoters and enhancers in addition to facultative heterochromatin. Selective knock-down of macroH2A1.1 deregulates expression of hundreds of highly active genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often develops resistance to single-agent treatment, which can be circumvented using targeted combinatorial approaches. Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 synergistically limits TNBC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LOXL2 interacts in the nucleus with the short isoform of BRD4 (BRD4S), MED1, and the cell cycle transcriptional regulator B-MyB. more...

Herein we define lysosomal acid lipase A (LIPA) as a viable molecular target in TNBC and identify a stereospecific small molecule (ERX-41) that binds LIPA. ERX-41 induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulting in cell death, and this effect is on target as evidenced by specific LIPA mutations providing resistance. more...

375. RNAseq analysis of human macrophages differentiated from monocytes exposed to extracellular vesicles from tumor cells or recombinant CSF-1
(Submitter supplied) Tumor  associated  macrophages  (TAMs),  which  differentiate  from  circulating  monocytes,  are pervasive across human cancers and comprise heterogeneous populations. The contribution of tumor-derived signals to TAM heterogeneity is not well understood. In particular, tumors release both soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose respective impact on TAM precursors may be different. Here, we show that triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) release EVs and soluble  molecules  promoting  monocyte  differentiation  towards  distinct  macrophage  fates.

388. RNA-seq of shE4F1 or shCTRL SUM159 triple negative breast cancer cell line treated or not with Gemcitabine
(Submitter supplied) E4F1 is a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger protein of the Gli-Kruppel family that was first identified, more than 30 years ago, as a cellular target of the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A13S (Ad type V), required for transcriptional regulation of adenoviral genes. In this study we investigated the impact of direct translational target genes on DNA damage response induced by Gemcitabine.   To do so, we performed RNAseq SUM159 triple negative breast cancer cell line. more...

392. Tumor infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells dictate divergent survival outcomes in pre- versus post-menopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), yet have no association with survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC. The basis for these contrasting findings remains elusive. We identify subsets of BC tumors infiltrated by CD8+ T cells with characteristic features of exhausted T cells (TEX). Tumors with abundant CD8+ TEX exhibit a distinct tumor microenvironment marked by amplified interferon-γ signaling related pathways and higher PD-L1 expression. more...

429. Identification of DNA methylation biomarkers for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer [EPIC Array]
(Submitter supplied) Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in triple-negative breast cancer is linked to long-term patient survival. However, response to NAC is highly variable and cannot reliably be predicted by clinical or other current methods. This study aims to address this problem by utilising the stable, yet dynamic marker known as DNA methylation. By defining the methylation differences at diagnosis in patients that achieve a pathological complete remission against those that do not respond, we can identify a marker that can potentially predict chemotherapy response and help further personalise the chemotherapy decision making in the clinic.

458. Gene expression profiling of TNBC cells engineered to knock-down or overexpress PTX3
(Submitter supplied) The pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) plays conflicting roles in cancer by acting as an oncosuppressor or as a pro-tumor mediator depending on tumor context. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most aggressive histotype of breast cancer, characterized by the lack of efficacious therapeutic targets/approaches and poor prognosis.  In this study, in silico data and experimental evidences indicate that PTX3 is produced by tumor parenchyma in TNBC and that its expression levels correlate with tumor stage. more...

459. Next Generation Sequencing of tumor tissue (4T1 cell) of BALB/c
(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), particularly programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), has shown considerable clinical  benefits in patients with various cancers. Many studies show that PD-L1 expression may be biomarkers to help select responders  for anti-PD-1 treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control PD-L1 expression. As a  potential chemosensitizer and anticancer drug, copper combined with disulfiram (DSF) kills tumor cells by regulating multiple  signaling pathways and transcription factors in vitro and in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) We reported that low expression of miRNA in cancer as a recognized signature leads to loss function of TSGs in breast cancer. In 157 paired breast cancer and adjacent normal samples, tumour suppressor gene GPER1 and miR-339 are both downregulated in Luminal A/B and Triple Negative Breast Cancer subtypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that that miR-339 upregulates GPER1 expression in breast cancer cells by switching on the GPER1 enhancer, which can be blocked by enhancer deletion through the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

498. Olaparib resistance and cisplatin responses in triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) PARP inhibitor and platinum based drugs such as cisplatin are promising therapies for triple negative breast cancer and exploit the deficiencies in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or homologous recombination repair defects. However, PARP inhibitor resistance is proven to be a major clinical problem. Acquired PARP inhibitor resistance has been linked with co-resistance to platinum-based drugs.  To determine how acquired olaparib resistance affects cisplatin response and whether this is influenced by their BRCA1 status, we performed RNAseq transcriptome analysis of isogenic triple negative breast cancer models of olaparib resistance with normal and mutant BRCA1.

504. Unique integrated stress response sensors regulate cancer cell susceptibility when Hsp70 activity is compromised
(Submitter supplied) Molecular chaperones prevent the accumulation of toxic proteins in the cell, but when chaperones are overwhelmed, the rapid modulation of proteostasis pathways provide corrective responses. One molecular chaperone in particular, Hsp70, plays a central role in both cellular protection and the response to proteotoxic insults. This is perhaps most evident in cancer cells, some of which overexpress Hsp70 and thrive even when harboring high levels of misfolded, aggregated, and/or unassembled protein complexes. more...

520. Targeting triple negative breast cancer with combination therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell and CDK7 inhibitor
(Submitter supplied) Epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (EGFR CAR-T) is potent and specific in suppressing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, a subset of mice soon acquired resistance, which limits the potential use of EGFR CAR-T. The aim of this study is to find a way to overcome the observed resistance. Transcriptomic analysis results revealed that EGFR CAR-T treatment led to the induction of a cohort of immunosuppressive genes, presumably through Interferon gamma (IFNγ signaling, in EGFR CAR-T-resistant TNBC tumors. more...

591. Lipid remodeling in response to methionine stress in MDA-MBA-468 triple-negative breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Methionine is an essential amino acid and critical precursor to the cellular methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. Unlike non-transformed cells, cancer cells have a unique metabolic requirement for methionine and are unable to proliferate in growth media where methionine is replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine. This metabolic vulnerability is common among cancer cells regardless of tissue origin and is known as “methionine dependence”, “methionine stress sensitivity”, or Hoffman effect. more...

593. Transcriptomic insight into salinomycin mechanisms in breast cancer cell lines: synergistic effects with dasatinib and induction of estrogen receptor beta
(Submitter supplied) Purpose:The use of a single-drug to encounter cancer progression is generally ineffective due to the tumors heterogeneity. To improve the clinical outcome, multiple drugs of distinctive mechanisms but complementary anticancer activities (combination therapy) are often used to enhance antitumor efficacy and minimize the risk of acquiring drug resistance. In this study, we proposed to use a combination of salinomycin (which targets anticancer stem cells) and dasatinib (an Src kinase inhibitor) for the treatment of breast cancer. more...

596. Expression data in 4T1 cells after co-culture with murine PI/AI BMDM macrophages
(Submitter supplied) Macrophages can exert both pro- and anti-tumorigenic features. Interaction between tumour-associated macrophages and tumour cells trigger signalling mechanisms affecting gene expression patterns in both cells. Changes in tumor gene expression affect essential physiological processes such as metabolism, proliferation or adhesion that can lead to an increased invasive and metastatic potential. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in tumour cells after pro-inflammatory (anti-tumorigenic, M1 or PI) or anti-inflammatory (pro-tumorigenic, M2 or AI) and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes during this process.

603. Genomic binding profiles for ZNF165, ZNF446, and SMAD3 in triple-negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) The testis protein ZNF165 is aberrantly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it modulates TGFβ signaling to promote tumor growth and survival. To investigate whether ZNF165 functions in this capacity via cooperation with SMAD3, a canonical TGFβ-induced transcription factor, we performed ChIP-seq for both factors in TNBC cell lines (WHIM12 and SUM159). Additionally, we established genomic binding profiles for ZNF446, a previously uncharacterized transcription factor that we have identified as a member of a ZNF165-SMAD3 complex. more...

(Submitter supplied) Although membrane-anchored PD-L1 has been well-studied for its engagement with PD-1 on T cells to evade anti-tumor immunity, whether PD-L1 regulate oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells remains elusive. We found that a portion of PD-L1 could translocate to the nucleus and knockout of PD-L1 changed RNA profiles in MDA-MB-231 cells. To further explore potential role of PD-L1 in regulating gene expression in tumor cells, we performed ChIP-seq in HA tag-inserted (after the signal peptide) PD-L1 re-expressed MBA-MB-231cells (endogenous PD-L1 knockout background). more...

619. A functional link between miR-200a and ELK3 regulates the metastatic nature of breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) The ectopic expression of miR-200a impaired the migration and invasion of TNBC cells by reducing the expression level of the ELK3 mRNA. An analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the control group - and miR-200a plus ELK3 group had similar genetic signatures that differed from that of the miR-200a alone group.

652. Loss of Lamin A/C in myeloid cells promotes lung metastasis through Gfi-1 and C/EBPe-mediated granulocytic differentiation
(Submitter supplied) The immune suppressive tumor microenvironment contributes to metastatic spread. In particular, tumor-associated myeloid cells, which differ from normal myeloid cells, suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for tumor-associated myeloid lineage differentiation and functional properties are not well understood. Here we report a lack of Lamin A/C, a nuclear lamina protein associated with chromatin remodeling, in tumor-associated granulocytic myeloid cells. more...

653. Whole genome expression profiling of triple negative breast tumors in 226 African American women
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Black/African American (AA) women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to whites, an aggressive breast cancer subtype associated with poor prognosis. There are no routinely used targeted clinical therapies for TNBC; thus there is a clear need to identify prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.  Methods: We evaluated expression of 27,016 genes in 155 treatment-naïve TN tumors from AA women in Detroit. more...

654. Long non-coding RNA RP11-19E11.1 is an E2F1 target required for tumor cell proliferation and survival in basal breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the regulation of breast cancer initiation and progression. LncRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast cancers are generally poorly differentiated tumors, are enriched in embryonic stem cell signatures, lack expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), and show activation of proliferation-associated factors. more...

655. Suppression of FOXM1 Activities and Breast Cancer Growth in Vitro and in Vivo by a New Class of Compounds
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor FOXM1 is up-regulated and overexpressed in aggressive, therapy-resistant forms of hormone receptor-positive and triple negative breast cancers, and is associated with less good patient survival. FOXM1 pathway signaling is also a key driver in other aggressive cancers, including those in prostate, lung, ovary, and gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, our goal has been to identify compounds effective in suppressing FOXM1 activity and breast cancer proliferation, and displaying good potency and pharmacokinetic properties for in vivo antitumor efficacy. more...

656. ChIP-chip data for identifying target genes and consensus binding sequences of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) The tumor suppressor p53 exerts its role mainly as a transcription factor. The TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, particularly triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Variations in the TP53 gene occur mainly in exons 5–8 and result in missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein that alter DNA binding specificity. To identify the target genes of mutant p53, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA microarray (ChIP-chip). more...

(Submitter supplied) β-caryophyllene (BCP) exhibits anti-proliferative properties in cancer cells.  Here, we examine the hypothesis that BCP induces membrane remodeling.  Our data show that high concentrations of BCP increase membrane permeability of human breast cells (hBrC) causing detachment and cell death.  At a “sub-lethal” concentration of BCP, we show that BCP induces a striking upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, including the gene that encodes for HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-determining step in cholesterol biosynthesis. more...

Previous pre-clinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphological phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional mitochondria and numerous lipid droplets. more...

(Submitter supplied) Protein hydroxylation extensively regulates cellular signaling by affecting protein stability, activity, and interactome, therefore contributing to the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancers. However, because of the transient nature of the hydroxylase-substrate interaction, identifying new prolyl hydroxylation substrates remains a daunting challenge. Here, by developing a novel enzyme-substrate trapping strategy coupled with TAP-TAG or orthogonal GST- purification followed by mass spectrometry, we identify Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) as a bona fide EglN2 prolyl hydroxylase substrate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most common cancer that threatens women's health. While the strategy of drug combination can help to reduce adverse effects and to overcome the resistance of clinical treatment of single drug. In this work, we report the synergetic effect between a HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG and a HDAC inhibitor Belinostat, on the triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The RNA-Seq data analysis showed that the most over-represented KEGG pathways in the combination group came from migration or invasion related genes, which were not observed in the differentially expressed genes after the treatment of 17-AAG or Belinostat alone.

(Submitter supplied) SIPA1 is a potential transcriptional modulator of tumor metastasis and recurrence. Here we showed that the breast cancer patients with higher SIPA1 expression have a higher relapse rate and worse prognosis, especially for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Moreover, SIPA1 expression was found positively correlated with relapse of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. In a TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, we identified the possible tumorigenesis and metastasis processes regulated by SIPA1, and demonstrated that SIPA1 promoted cancer stem-like feature to form tumourspheres. more...

740. SMAD2 binding regions in triple negative breast cancer cell line, Hs578T
(Submitter supplied) Inhibitors for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6 have been established as effective therapeutic options for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Although the CDK4/6 inhibitors mainly target the cyclin D-CDK4/6-retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) axis, little is known about clinical impact of inhibiting phosphorylation of other CDK4/6 target proteins. Here, we have focused on other CDK4/6 targets, SMAD proteins. We showed that a CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib and Activin-SMAD2 signaling cooperatively inhibited cell cycle progression of a luminal-type breast cancer cell line T47D. Mechanistically, Palbociclib enhanced SMAD2 binding to the genome through inhibiting linker phosphorylation of the SMAD2 protein by CDK4/6. Comparison of the SMAD2 ChIP-seq data of T47D with those of a triple-negative breast cancer cell line Hs578T indicated that Palbociclib augments different SMAD2-mediated program defined based on types of cells, and enhances SMAD2 binding to the target regions on the genome without affecting its binding pattern. Collectively, the CDK4/6 inhibitor facilitates the cytostatic effects of Activin-SMAD2, while it also enhances its tumor promoting effects depending on types of breast cancer.

(Submitter supplied) The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 play an essential role in cell fate decisions, embryonic development and gene regulation. While the functions of PRC2 in cancer are under intense study, the function of PRC1 in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that RNF2, the gene encoding RING1B, and canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) genes are amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Specifically, in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer cells, cPRC1 is functionally associated with enhancers and genes regulated by ERa, while in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, a different cPRC1 variant is recruited to enhancers and promoters occupied by the bromodomain protein BRD4. more...

(Submitter supplied) The IRE1 Rnase domain has been implicated in the pathology of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease with limited treatment options. The IRE1 Rnase mediates it's effects on the transcriptome via activation of the trancription factor XBP1s and via direct cleavage of mRNA through a process called RIDD. The processes through which the RNase domain contributes to TNBC is not fully understood. We used a novel small molecule inhibitor of the IRE1 Rnase to find novel targets of IRE1 in TNBC, in an effort to elucidate how it contributes to the disease.

825. Analysis of the miR-34 family functions in breast cancer reveals annotation error of miR-34b
(Submitter supplied) The miR-34 family of microRNAs consisting of miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c are tumour suppressors. The annotated human miR-34b-5p has one additional base at the 5’ end of the common miR-34 family seed sequence, compared to miR-34a-5p and miR-34c-5p. This extra base results in a shift of the seed sequence, which would affect the target gene repertoire and have functional consequences. During our studies of miR-34 functions, we investigated the precise sequence of mature miR-34b-5p in human cells by deep sequencing. more...

872. Regulation of miRNA-29c and its downstream pathways in preneoplastic progression of triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Little is understood about the early molecular drivers of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), making the identification of women at risk and development of targeted therapy for prevention significant challenges. By sequencing a TNBC cell line-based breast cancer progression model we have found that miRNA-29c is progressively lost during TNBC tumorigenesis.   In support of the tumor suppressive role of miRNA 29c, we found that low levels predict poor overall patient survival and, conversely, that ectopic expression of miRNA-29c in preneoplastic cell models inhibits growth. more...

881. The footprint of the aging stroma in older breast cancer patients.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Tumoral masses are not only composed of malignant cells, but also enclose a more or less ample stromal micromilieu, which has been shown to influence the cancer cell behaviour. As aging induces accumulation of senescent cells in the body, this micromilieu is thought to be different in cancers occurring in old patients compared to the younger counterparts. More specifically, senescence-related fibroblastic features, such as the Senescence Associated Secretory Profile (SASP) and the induction of Autophagy, are suspected to stimulate tumor growth and progression. more...

893. Antibody-induced CD47 signaling suppresses triple-negative breast cancer stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Intercellular communication is critical for integrating complex signals in multicellular eukaryotes.  Vascular endothelial cells and T lymphocytes closely interact during the recirculation and trans-endothelial migration of T cells.  In addition to direct cell-cell contact, we show that T cell derived extracellular vesicles can interact with endothelial cells and modulate their cellular functions.  Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Glucocorticoids (GC) have been widely used as coadjuvants in the treatment of solid tumors, but GC treatment may be associated with poor pharmacotherapeutic response and/or prognosis. The genomic action of GC in these tumors is largely unknown. Here we find that dexamethasone (Dex, a synthetic GC) regulated genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are associated with drug resistance. Importantly, these GC-regulated genes are aberrantly expressed in TNBC patients and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) commonly metastasizes to the brain and predicts poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options. TNBC frequently harbors BRCA mutations translating to platinum sensitivity; platinum response may be augmented by additional suppression of DNA repair mechanisms through poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibition. We evaluated brain penetrance and efficacy of Carboplatin +/- the PARP inhibitor ABT888, and investigated gene expression changes in murine intracranial (IC) TNBC models stratified by BRCA and molecular subtype status. more...

(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidence suggests that tumor cells metastasize by co-opting stem cell transcriptional networks, although the molecular underpinnings of this process are poorly understood.  Here, we show for the first time that the high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene drives metastatic progression in triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by reprogramming cancer cells to a stem-like state.  We  discovered an HMGA1 signature in triple negative breast cancer cells that is highly enriched in embryonic stem cells. more...

955. BCL11A is a triple-negative breast cancer gene with critical functions in stem and progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognostic outcome compared to other types  of breast cancer1. At present the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TNBC  pathology are not well understood1. Here we report that the transcription factor BCL11A is  overexpressed in TNBC including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and that its genomic locus  is amplified in up to 38% of BLBC tumours. BCL11A overexpression in immortalised human  breast epithelial cells promotes tumour formation in xenograft models, whereas knockdown  of BCL11A in TNBC cell lines suppresses their tumourigenic potential. In the DMBA-induced  mouse mammary tumour model, Bcl11a is found to be essential for tumourigenesis since  deletion of Bcl11a before DMBA treatment substantially decreases tumour formation, even in  p53-null cells, and inactivation of Bcl11a in established tumours causes their regression. At  the cellular level, BCL11A overexpression enhances clonogenicity in vitro whereas its deletion  in the mouse causes a reduction in the number of mammary epithelial stem and progenitor  cells. Thus, BCL11A has an important role in the genesis of TNBC and in normal mammary  epithelial cells. This study highlights the importance of further investigation of BCL11A in  breast cancer diagnosis and targeted therapies.

(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

963. Insights into the invasiveness of triple negative breast cancer from genome-wide profiling of transcription factor AP-1 (ChIP-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA from tumors treated with vehicle or 30 mg/kg GTx-027 were pooled and subjected to microarray analysis. Genes that were increased or decreased by 2-fold or more were considered for further analyses. Unlike in prostate cancer, where AR agonists induce more genes than they repress, in MDA-MB-231-AR tumors, GTx-027 inhibited 2.5X the number of genes (1092 vs. 456) than it activated. Functional clustering of the genes indicated that GTx-027 modified more breast cancer genes than other pathway genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that lack targeted clinical therapies. In addition, TNBC is heterogeneous and was recently further sub-classified into seven TNBC subtypes that displayed unique gene expression patterns. To develop therapeutic treatment regimens, we established seven patient-derived xenograft models from TNBC tumors. These xenograft models not only retained the histology and clinical markers of the corresponding patient tumors, but also bearing the same mutations and deletions identified in the patient tumors. more...

968. Histone variant H3.3-specific readout of H3K36 trimethylation by ZMYND11 links transcription elongation control to tumour suppression
(Submitter supplied) Recognition of modified histones by “reader” proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription1. H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions following RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin at an appropriate state to suppress cryptic transcription2,3. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. more...

969. Expression profiling of migrated and invaded breast cancer cells predicts early metastatic relapse and reveals Krüppel-like factor 9 as a potential suppressor of invasive growth in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Cell motility and invasion initiate metastasis. However, only a subpopulation of cancer cells within a tumor will ultimately become invasive. Due to this stochastic and transient nature, in an experimental setting, migrating and invading cells need to be isolated from the general population in order to study the gene expression profiles linked to these processes. This report describes microarray analysis on RNA derived from migrated or invaded subpopulations of triple negative breast cancer cells in a Transwell set-up, at two different time points during motility and invasion, pre-determined as “early” and “late” in real-time kinetic assessments. more...

(Submitter supplied) The DKAT cell line is a novel model of triple-negative breast cancer that was isolated from the pleural effusion of a 35 year-old caucasian woman with triple-negative breast cancer. When cultured in serum-free media (MEGM, Lonza) this cell line exhibits an epithelial morphology and gene expression pattern. However, when cultured in the presence of serum (SCGM, Lonza) it undergoes a reversible EMT. We used microarrays to look at gene expression changes in the DKAT cell line when cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Media (MEGM, where DKAT cells have an epithelial morphology) vs Stromal Cell Growth Media (SCGM, where DKAT cells have a mesenchymal morphology).

(Submitter supplied) Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family, exists and functions wholly within the tumor microenvironment to suppress tumorigenesis by directly targeting and antagonizing multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR and Met. This leads to potent and sustained signal attenuation, growth arrest, and angiostasis. We thus sought to evaluate the tumoricidal benefits of systemic decorin on a triple-negative orthotopic breast carcinoma xenograft model. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, the genes which relate to promote tumor aggressiveness in TNBC remain unclear. In order to investigate specific genes and pathways involved in TNBC tumorigenesis, we compared genes differentially expressed between 3D cultures (3DC) or tumor xenograft models and control two-dimensional cultures (2DC).

Cancer cells with intact DNA repair can avoid the accumulation of genome damage during growth and also can repair platinum-induced DNA damage. We sought genomic signatures indicative of defective DNA repair in cell lines and tumors and correlated these signatures to platinum sensitivity. The number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere (NtAI) predicted cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and pathologic response to preoperative cisplatin treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). more...

However, in typical tumor specimens collected in clinical studies, up to 60% of the DNA derives from stromal cells with a normal genome, resulting in attenuated sensitivity to true somatic aberrations in the tumor. Here we describe SNPfilter, a model-based method to decompose SNP array data from heterogeneous tumor specimens into their corresponding normal and tumor profiles. more...

(Submitter supplied) Current prognostic gene expression profiles for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and are most useful in ER-positive cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are clinically heterogeneous, and prognostic markers and biology-based therapies are needed to better treat this disease.  We assembled Affymetrix gene expression data for 579 TNBCs and performed unsupervised analysis to define metagenes that distinguish molecular subsets within TNBC. more...

999. GATA3 Reprograms Basal Breast Cancer Cells towards a Luminal Subtype and Inhibits Metastases through Suppression of Lysyl Oxidase
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor GATA3 is essential for luminal cell differentiation during mammary gland development and critical for formation of the luminal subtypes of breast cancer. Ectopic expression of GATA3 promoted global alterations of the transcriptome of basal triple-negative breast cancer cells resulting in molecular and cellular changes associated with a more differentiated, luminal tumor subtype and a concomitant reduction in primary tumor growth, lung metastasis, and macrophage recruitment at the metastatic site. more...

1001. Suppression of breast tumor growth and metastasis by an engineered transcription factor
(Submitter supplied) Abstract Maspin is a tumor and metastasis suppressor playing an essential role as gatekeeper of tumor progression. It is highly expressed in epithelial cells but is silenced in the onset of metastatic disease by epigenetic mechanisms. Reprogramming of Maspin epigenetic silencing offers a therapeutic potential to lock metastatic progression. Herein we have investigated the ability of the Artificial Transcription Factor 126 (ATF-126) designed to upregulate the Maspin promoter to inhibit tumor progression in pre-established breast tumors in immunodeficient mice. more...

1002. FZD7 Plays a Critical Role in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. Triple negative cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer usually associated with poor outcome and lack of benefit from target therapy. A pathway analysis in a microarray study was performed using TNBC compared with non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Overexpression of several Wnt pathway genes, such as frizzled homolog 7 (FZD7), Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) has been observed in TNBC. more...

1003. A phenotype-based model for rational selection of novel targeted therapies in treating aggressive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Treating unselected cancer patients with new drugs dilutes proof of efficacy when only a fraction of patients respond to therapy. We conducted a meta-analysis on eight primary breast cancer microarray datasets representing diverse breast cancer phenotypes. We present a high-throughput protocol which incorporates drug sensitivity signatures to guide preclinical testing for effective therapeutic agents. more...
