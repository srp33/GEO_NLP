(Submitter supplied) Typical multiomics studies employ separate methods for DNA, RNA, and protein sample preparation, which is labor intensive, costly, and prone to sampling bias. We describe a method for preparing high-quality, sequencing-ready DNA and RNA, and either intact proteins or mass-spectrometry-ready peptides for whole proteome analysis from a single sample. This method utilizes a reversible protein tagging scheme to covalently link all proteins in a lysate to a bead-based matrix and nucleic acid precipitation and selective solubilization to yield separate pools of protein and nucleic acids. more...

2. A continuous ferroptosis-to-apoptosis landscape identifies ferroptosis biomarkers and repressors for cancer therapy
(Submitter supplied) Ferroptosis, a cell death pathway driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in several human diseases including cancer. Although ferroptosis is entwined with apoptosis, it currently has no   characteristic biomarkers or gene signature. In this project we established a continuous phenotypic gradient between ferroptosis and apoptosis and coupled it to transcriptomic and metabolomic landscapes. Omics and mechanistic studies revealed that ferroptosis was associated with enhanced MITF activity, lysosomal function, glutaminolysis, TCA cycle, and activation of ATF4, while its transition into apoptosis was attributed to enhanced ER-stress, ATF4/CHOP switch and PE/PC metabolic shift. more...

7. Connective Tissue Growth Factor, a Potential Prognostic Marker of Triple Negative Breast Cancer treatment
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient with high level of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) show poor survival and prognosis. Identification of novel target contributes to the development of TNBC treatment. Kahweol, a coffee diterpene molecule, is a natural compound with pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic, and apoptotic effect in several cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of CTGF expression level in TNBC treatment. Experiments were performed on MDA-MB 231, a TNBC cell line. Firstly, functional annotation and gene set enrichment analysis found that the CTGF involves in migratory pathways in TNBC treatment. We also investigated that kahweol regulates CTGF expression and functions as antitumor compound resulting in inhibition of cell migration and colony formation in TNBC. Next, CTGF knockdown synergically suppressed cell motility with kahweol. Migratory ability and colony conformation were also performed in vitro to confirm the results from functional annotation assay. Overall, our results suggest that CTGF is a potential target as a prognostic marker predicting the prognosis of TNBC treatment, and kahweol is a potential antitumor compound to regulate CTGF expression for TNBC.

(Submitter supplied) Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which can function as regulators of gene expression, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here, we uncover a pathway specific for nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, Exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter, CRM1, selectively increases nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. more...

35. MYC enhancer invasion promotes prognostic cancer type-specific gene programs through an epigenetic switch [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor MYC is overexpressed in most cancers, where it drives multiple hallmarks of cancer progression. MYC is known to promote oncogenic transcription by binding to active promoters. In addition, MYC has also been shown to invade distal enhancers when expressed at oncogenic levels, but this enhancer binding has been proposed to have low gene-regulatory potential. Here, we demonstrate that MYC enhancer binding directly promotes cancer type-specific gene programs predictive of poor patient prognosis. more...

36. Nuclear export of circular RNA
(Submitter supplied) Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are increasingly being implicated in a variety of functions in normal and cancerous cells1-5, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus6-10. circRNAs are predom¬inantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here, we uncover a pathway specific for nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, Exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. more...

38. Transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism by KDM2B, in the context of ncPRC1.1 and in concert with MYC and ATF4 [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) KDM2B encodes a JmjC domain-containing histone lysine demethylase, which functions as an oncogene in several types of tumors, including TNBC. This study was initiated to address the cancer relevance of the results of our earlier work, which had shown that overexpression of KDM2B renders mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resistant to oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant mechanisms.  Methods We mainly employed a multi-omics strategy consisting of RNA-Seq, quantitative TMT proteomics, Mass-spectrometry-based global metabolomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-seq, to explore the role of KDM2B in the resistance to oxidative stress and intermediary metabolism. more...

70. Inhibitory effect of VNLG-152R on breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231
(Submitter supplied) In previous studies, our research demonstrated that VNLG-152R exhibits inhibitory effects on Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells both in vitro and in vivo. The TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with VNLG-152R. A total of 337 genes were differentially expressed when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 μM VNLG-152R for 24h; 259 genes were upregulated and 78 downregulated. Through proteome analyses, we discovered that VNLG-152R upregulates the expression of E3 ligase Synoviolin 1 (SYVN1), also called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) in TNBC cells. more...

72. A first-in-class fully modified version of miR-34a with outstanding stability, activity, and anti-tumor efficacy
(Submitter supplied) Altered by defects in p53, epigenetic silencing, and genomic loss, the microRNA miR-34a represents one of the most clinically relevant tumor-suppressive microRNAs. Without question, a striking number of patients with cancer would benefit from miR-34a replacement, if poor miR-34a stability, non-specific delivery, and delivery-associated toxicity could be overcome. Here, we highlight a fully modified version of miR-34a (FM-miR-34a) that overcomes these hurdles when conjugated to a synthetically simplistic ligand. more...

75. Role of EGR1 in vasculogenic mimicry of MDA-MB-231 cells
(Submitter supplied) Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is an intriguing phenomenon observed in tumor masses, in which cancer cells organize themselves into capillary-like channels that closely resemble the structure and function of blood vessels. Although VM is believed to contribute to alternative tumor vascularization, the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes remain poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the role of Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) in regulating VM in aggressive cancer cells, specifically MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.

76. Induction of viral mimicry upon loss of DHX9 and ADAR1 in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is an important component of innate immunity. Proteins like PKR and MDA5 recognize dsRNA and activate various pathways to fight viral infection. In addition to viral dsRNA, many endogenous RNAs containing double-stranded regions can be misrecognized as immunogenic. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, specifically its p150 isoform, has been shown to suppress activation of PKR and MDA5 through its A-to-I editing activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) HDAC3 and HDAC8 are members of class I deacetylases involved in several biological mechanisms and represent a highly sought-after therapeutic target for drug development. It is historically challenging to develop selective deacetylase inhibitors due to their conserved catalytic domains. HDAC3 also has deacetylase-independent activity, which cannot be blocked by conventional enzymatic inhibitors. Recent advance in proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) provides an opportunity to eliminate the whole protein selectively, abolishing both enzymatic and scaffolding function. more...

142. Effect of GATA3 suppression gene expression in breast cancer cells.
(Submitter supplied) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the major pre-treatment for breast cancer before surgery. Patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) have a higher chance to receive lumpectomy and a better quality of life after neoadjuvant treatment. Luminal subtype breast cancer has poor NAC response compared with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this chemoresistance are not fully understood. more...

219. SAM68 is a splicing regulator in triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) SAM68 is an RNA binding protein frequently up-regulated in several human cancers and its oncogenic activity has often been associated with its splicing activity. Nevertheless, the genome-wide impact of SAM68 on the transcriptome of cancer cells is still unknown. Herein,  by high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis of MDA-MB-231 SAM68-silenced cells, we uncover an extensive modulation of triple-negative breast cancer cell transcriptome by this splicing factor.

To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we mapped the genome-wide localization of endogenous macroH2A1.1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231. We demonstrate that macroH2A1.1 specifically binds to active promoters and enhancers in addition to facultative heterochromatin. Selective knock-down of macroH2A1.1 deregulates expression of hundreds of highly active genes. more...

225. RNAseq analysis of human macrophages differentiated from monocytes exposed to extracellular vesicles from tumor cells or recombinant CSF-1
(Submitter supplied) Tumor  associated  macrophages  (TAMs),  which  differentiate  from  circulating  monocytes,  are pervasive across human cancers and comprise heterogeneous populations. The contribution of tumor-derived signals to TAM heterogeneity is not well understood. In particular, tumors release both soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose respective impact on TAM precursors may be different. Here, we show that triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) release EVs and soluble  molecules  promoting  monocyte  differentiation  towards  distinct  macrophage  fates.

283. Tumor-reactive tissue resident memory T cells, regulatory T cells and prognosis in early luminal-like breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Luminal-like breast cancer (BC) constitutes the majority of BC subtypes, but, differently from highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), is poorly infiltrated by the immune system. The quality of the immune infiltrate in luminal-like BCs has been poorly studied, thus a biological basis for the further investigation of immunotherapeutic strategies is missing. By using high-dimensional single-cell technologies, we identified heterogeneous behavior within the tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells infiltrating luminal-like tumors. more...

In 157 paired breast cancer and adjacent normal samples, tumour suppressor gene GPER1 and miR-339 are both downregulated in Luminal A/B and Triple Negative Breast Cancer subtypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that that miR-339 upregulates GPER1 expression in breast cancer cells by switching on the GPER1 enhancer, which can be blocked by enhancer deletion through the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

(Submitter supplied) Molecular chaperones prevent the accumulation of toxic proteins in the cell, but when chaperones are overwhelmed, the rapid modulation of proteostasis pathways provide corrective responses. One molecular chaperone in particular, Hsp70, plays a central role in both cellular protection and the response to proteotoxic insults. This is perhaps most evident in cancer cells, some of which overexpress Hsp70 and thrive even when harboring high levels of misfolded, aggregated, and/or unassembled protein complexes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Conditional overexpression of histone reader Tripartite motif containing protein 24 (TRIM24) in mouse mammary epithelia (Trim24COE) drives spontaneous development of carcinosarcoma tumors, lacking ER, PR and HER2. Human carcinosarcomas or metaplastic breast cancers (MpBC) are a rare, chemorefractory subclass of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Comparison of Trim24COE carcinosarcoma morphology, TRIM24 protein levels and a derived Trim24COE gene signature revealed strong correlation with human MpBC tumors and MpBC xenograft (PDX) models. more...

320. Long non-coding RNA landscape of patients biopsies from advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) The response to specific treatments relies on precise biomarkers, thereby avoiding undesirable toxicities and diminishing the cost. Due to the lack of treatment options in triple-negative breast cancer, it is crucial to search biomarkers with reasonable specificity and sensibility to recognize clusters of patients who could benefit from the cutting-edge oncologist treatments available nowadays. Microarrays were used to detail the global gene expression program to stratified TNBC patients according to TNBCtype software developed by Vanderbilt University and then identified lncRNAs expressed differentially through the TNBC subtypes.

321. Tubacin mediates the synthetic lethality of cysteine in breast cancer independent on HDAC6
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a highly aggressive nature and distinct molecular characteristics from other subtypes of breast cancer and lacks effective targeted therapy. The molecular and genetic basis of cysteine/cystine dependency in TNBC is complex. We found that cysteine addiction associates with the expression of a set of Claudin genes in TNBC. The Claudin-high TNBCs are independent on cystine, while the Claudin-low TNBCs undergo rapid ferroptosis upon cystine deprivation or inhibition of cystine transport by erastin. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and highly lethal disease. Due to its heterogeneity and lack of hormone receptors or HER2 expression, it is critical to identify novel therapeutic targets in TNBC. Analysis of copy number and gene expression in tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas suggested that ZHX2 was amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer patients. Correspondingly, we found that ZHX2 was highly expressed in TNBC cell lines and TNBC patient tissues. more...

326. Targeting triple negative breast cancer with combination therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell and CDK7 inhibitor
(Submitter supplied) Epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (EGFR CAR-T) is potent and specific in suppressing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, a subset of mice soon acquired resistance, which limits the potential use of EGFR CAR-T. The aim of this study is to find a way to overcome the observed resistance. Transcriptomic analysis results revealed that EGFR CAR-T treatment led to the induction of a cohort of immunosuppressive genes, presumably through Interferon gamma (IFNγ signaling, in EGFR CAR-T-resistant TNBC tumors. more...

351. RNA-seq in Hs578T cells stimulated with TGF-β
(Submitter supplied) Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) comprises a key component in the tumor microenvironment. It is reported that TGF-β can be pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic depending on various contexts. Some of the triple negative breast cancers highly express TGF-β, but pro-tumorigenic function of TGF-β in triple negative breast cancer cells is not fully known. Therefore, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression changes after stimulation with TGF-β in a triple negative breast cancer cell line, Hs578T cells.

366. Differential Gene Expression in MDA-MB231 from transduction of cells with shRNA targeting CDK19 and CDK8
(Submitter supplied) When CDK19 was initially discovered, it was assumed that CDK19 played a redundant role to CDK8 because they share 84% amino acid sequence similarity. However, biological clues such as CDK19s different chromosomal location and its more limited tissue distribution suggested a role distinct from CDK8 To investigate whether CDK19 and CDK8 had distinct biological functions in Triple-Negative breast cancer, we knocked down CDK19 and CDK8 in MDA-MB231 and examined differences in the resulting gene expression.

417. Transcriptomic analysis of DOXO-Resistant cells compared to parental DOXO-Sensitive mda-mb-436 cell line
(Submitter supplied) The major obstacle in successfully treating triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the mainstay of treatment in this disease. Previous pre-clinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphological phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional mitochondria and numerous lipid droplets. more...

418. Inhibition of TNBC metastasis by Gpx1
(Submitter supplied) Gpx1 plays a vital role in the metastasis of TNBC cells by regulating cell adhesion. Depletion of Gpx1 reduces the survival, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells in vitro. Transcriptomic and signaling pathway analyses demonstrate that depletion of Gpx1 essentially impairs cell adhesion/spreading by down-regulating FAK/c-Src activation.

(Submitter supplied) The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 play an essential role in cell fate decisions, embryonic development and gene regulation. While the functions of PRC2 in cancer are under intense study, the function of PRC1 in cancer remains largely unexplored.

488. MDA-MB-231 gene expression upon IRE1 RNase inhibition with MKC-8866
(Submitter supplied) The IRE1 Rnase domain has been implicated in the pathology of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease with limited treatment options. The IRE1 Rnase mediates it's effects on the transcriptome via activation of the trancription factor XBP1s and via direct cleavage of mRNA through a process called RIDD. The processes through which the RNase domain contributes to TNBC is not fully understood. We used a novel small molecule inhibitor of the IRE1 Rnase to find novel targets of IRE1 in TNBC, in an effort to elucidate how it contributes to the disease.

To investigate the underlying biology, we conduct single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary TNBC. Intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs within each tumor was variable and largely correlated with clonality of inferred genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression phenotype of individual subpopulations. more...

521. 5hmC and gene expression data in breast cancer cell lines treated with an antioxidant
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we identify genes with enriched 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC) modifications correlated with gene expression in breast cancer cell lines treated with an antioxidant. Results of our differential analysis showed that treatment with an antioxidant caused significant changes to gene-localized 5hmC enrichment patterns in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. The 5hmC enrichment results were validated in a set of patient specimens when compared with adjacent non cancer tissue.

(Submitter supplied) The miR-34 family of microRNAs consisting of miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c are tumour suppressors. The annotated human miR-34b-5p has one additional base at the 5’ end of the common miR-34 family seed sequence, compared to miR-34a-5p and miR-34c-5p. This extra base results in a shift of the seed sequence, which would affect the target gene repertoire and have functional consequences. During our studies of miR-34 functions, we investigated the precise sequence of mature miR-34b-5p in human cells by deep sequencing. more...

559. Development of gene expression signatures for the HDF and MDA-MB-231 cells that received TP4 (a cationic antimicrobial peptide) treatment
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks therapeutic target and is difficult to treat. We report a cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAP), tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4), derived from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), selectively toxic to TNBC. Here we aim to identify potential target in TNBC cell response to TP4 treatment by microarray study and to further address the role of TP4-resposive genes involved in TNBC cell death.

563. The footprint of the aging stroma in older breast cancer patients.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Tumoral masses are not only composed of malignant cells, but also enclose a more or less ample stromal micromilieu, which has been shown to influence the cancer cell behaviour. As aging induces accumulation of senescent cells in the body, this micromilieu is thought to be different in cancers occurring in old patients compared to the younger counterparts. More specifically, senescence-related fibroblastic features, such as the Senescence Associated Secretory Profile (SASP) and the induction of Autophagy, are suspected to stimulate tumor growth and progression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Intercellular communication is critical for integrating complex signals in multicellular eukaryotes.  Vascular endothelial cells and T lymphocytes closely interact during the recirculation and trans-endothelial migration of T cells.  In addition to direct cell-cell contact, we show that T cell derived extracellular vesicles can interact with endothelial cells and modulate their cellular functions.  Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells. more...

596. Expression data to identify putative transcriptional targets of ZNF165 in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
(Submitter supplied) We found that the cancer testis antigen, ZNF165, is required for viability and can modulate TGFβ-induced gene expression in mesenchymal, Claudin-Low, TNBC. We employed the Affymetrix microarray platform to uncover transcriptionally modulated genes following ZNF165 depletion and TGFβ stimulation using the Claudin-low TNBC tumor-derived cell lines, SUM159 as a model. Our results provide insight into how ZNF165 globally modulates TGFβ signaling. more...

The genomic action of GC in these tumors is largely unknown. Here we find that dexamethasone (Dex, a synthetic GC) regulated genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are associated with drug resistance. Importantly, these GC-regulated genes are aberrantly expressed in TNBC patients and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) commonly metastasizes to the brain and predicts poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options. TNBC frequently harbors BRCA mutations translating to platinum sensitivity; platinum response may be augmented by additional suppression of DNA repair mechanisms through poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibition. We evaluated brain penetrance and efficacy of Carboplatin +/- the PARP inhibitor ABT888, and investigated gene expression changes in murine intracranial (IC) TNBC models stratified by BRCA and molecular subtype status. more...

(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidence suggests that tumor cells metastasize by co-opting stem cell transcriptional networks, although the molecular underpinnings of this process are poorly understood.  Here, we show for the first time that the high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene drives metastatic progression in triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by reprogramming cancer cells to a stem-like state.  We  discovered an HMGA1 signature in triple negative breast cancer cells that is highly enriched in embryonic stem cells. more...

They  are involved in the Wnt pathway itself, and also in TGFß, p53 and Hedgehog pathways. Thorough characterization of these novel potential Wnt target genes may reveal new regulators of the canonical Wnt pathway. more...

619. BCL11A is a triple-negative breast cancer gene with critical functions in stem and progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognostic outcome compared to other types  of breast cancer1. At present the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TNBC  pathology are not well understood1. Here we report that the transcription factor BCL11A is  overexpressed in TNBC including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and that its genomic locus  is amplified in up to 38% of BLBC tumours. BCL11A overexpression in immortalised human  breast epithelial cells promotes tumour formation in xenograft models, whereas knockdown  of BCL11A in TNBC cell lines suppresses their tumourigenic potential. In the DMBA-induced  mouse mammary tumour model, Bcl11a is found to be essential for tumourigenesis since  deletion of Bcl11a before DMBA treatment substantially decreases tumour formation, even in  p53-null cells, and inactivation of Bcl11a in established tumours causes their regression. At  the cellular level, BCL11A overexpression enhances clonogenicity in vitro whereas its deletion  in the mouse causes a reduction in the number of mammary epithelial stem and progenitor  cells. Thus, BCL11A has an important role in the genesis of TNBC and in normal mammary  epithelial cells. This study highlights the importance of further investigation of BCL11A in  breast cancer diagnosis and targeted therapies.

(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions following RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin at an appropriate state to suppress cryptic transcription2,3. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. more...

630. Expression profiling of migrated and invaded breast cancer cells predicts early metastatic relapse and reveals Krüppel-like factor 9 as a potential suppressor of invasive growth in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Cell motility and invasion initiate metastasis. However, only a subpopulation of cancer cells within a tumor will ultimately become invasive. Due to this stochastic and transient nature, in an experimental setting, migrating and invading cells need to be isolated from the general population in order to study the gene expression profiles linked to these processes. This report describes microarray analysis on RNA derived from migrated or invaded subpopulations of triple negative breast cancer cells in a Transwell set-up, at two different time points during motility and invasion, pre-determined as “early” and “late” in real-time kinetic assessments. more...

635. Yale Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cohort
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high proliferation, poor differentiation and a poor prognosis due to high rates of recurrence. Despite lower overall incidence African American (AA) patients suffer from higher breast cancer mortality in part due to the higher proportion of TNBC cases among AA patients compared to European Americans (EA). It was recently shown that the clinical heterogeneity of TNBC is reflected by distinct transcriptional programs with distinct drug response profiles in preclinical models. more...

(Submitter supplied) Efforts to improve the clinical outcome of highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have been hindered by the lack of effective targeted therapies. Thus, it is important to identify the specific gene targets/pathways driving the invasive phenotype to develop more effective therapeutics. Here we show that ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing B (UBASH3B), a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is overexpressed in TNBC, where it supports malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis largely through modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). more...

641. SHARP1 suppresses breast cancer metastasis by promoting degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors
(Submitter supplied) Triple Negative Breast cancer accounts for some of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. By interrogating clinical datasets, we found that the activities of p63 and Hypoxia-Inducible-Factors (HIFs), two master regulators of the invasive and metastatic cancer cell phenotype are  linked in TNBC through the p63-target Sharp1. Mechanistically, Sharp1 promotes HIF-1α/HIF-2α proteasomal degradation by serving as HIFs presenting factor to the proteasome independently from oxygen levels and prior ubiquitination. more...

644. Expression data from DKAT breast cancer cell line pre- and post-EMT
(Submitter supplied) The DKAT cell line is a novel model of triple-negative breast cancer that was isolated from the pleural effusion of a 35 year-old caucasian woman with triple-negative breast cancer. When cultured in serum-free media (MEGM, Lonza) this cell line exhibits an epithelial morphology and gene expression pattern. However, when cultured in the presence of serum (SCGM, Lonza) it undergoes a reversible EMT. We used microarrays to look at gene expression changes in the DKAT cell line when cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Media (MEGM, where DKAT cells have an epithelial morphology) vs Stromal Cell Growth Media (SCGM, where DKAT cells have a mesenchymal morphology).

646. Dynamic re-wiring of apoptotic signaling networks enhances tumor cell killing by DNA damage
(Submitter supplied) Crosstalk and complexity within signaling pathways has limited our ability to devise rational strategies for using network biology to treat human disease. This is particularly problematic in cancer where oncogenes that drive or maintain the tumorigenic state alter the normal flow of molecular information within signaling networks that control growth, survival and death. Understanding the architecture of oncogenic signaling pathways, and how these networks are re-wired by ligands or drugs, could provide opportunities for the specific targeting of oncogene-driven tumors. more...

647. Expression analysis of tumor microenvironment in triple-negative breast carcinoma in xenograft model
(Submitter supplied) Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family, exists and functions wholly within the tumor microenvironment to suppress tumorigenesis by directly targeting and antagonizing multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR and Met. This leads to potent and sustained signal attenuation, growth arrest, and angiostasis. We thus sought to evaluate the tumoricidal benefits of systemic decorin on a triple-negative orthotopic breast carcinoma xenograft model. more...

648. Gene expression profiles of triple-negative breast cancer cells under the condition of 3D proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, the genes which relate to promote tumor aggressiveness in TNBC remain unclear. In order to investigate specific genes and pathways involved in TNBC tumorigenesis, we compared genes differentially expressed between 3D cultures (3DC) or tumor xenograft models and control two-dimensional cultures (2DC).

654. Suppression of breast tumor growth and metastasis by an engineered transcription factor
(Submitter supplied) Abstract Maspin is a tumor and metastasis suppressor playing an essential role as gatekeeper of tumor progression. It is highly expressed in epithelial cells but is silenced in the onset of metastatic disease by epigenetic mechanisms. Reprogramming of Maspin epigenetic silencing offers a therapeutic potential to lock metastatic progression. Herein we have investigated the ability of the Artificial Transcription Factor 126 (ATF-126) designed to upregulate the Maspin promoter to inhibit tumor progression in pre-established breast tumors in immunodeficient mice. more...
