1. Effects of a humanized CD47 antibody and SIRPα on triple negative breast carcinoma stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα, designated CD172a), also called SHPS-1 (SHP substrate 1) binds to CD47, a receptor for Thromobospondin-1 (TSP1). To block CD47-SIRP interaction, several CD47 blocking agents are in clinical trials. The purpose of this project is to explore the effects of SIRPFc signaling on bCSCs (breast cancer stem cells) derived from MDA-MB- 231 cells, when bCSCs were treated with either SIRPFc or CD47 blocking antibody CC90002 from Celgene Corporation.

2. Time-course  tracking of physical proximity and its effect on gene expression for elucidating single NK and cancer cell interactions using a microfluidic platform 
(Submitter supplied) We report a platform that combines the capture, co-incubation, time-lapse imaging, and gene expression profiling of doublets using the microfluidic integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) which could be used for real-time physical and transcriptional cell-cell interaction quantification. The temporal variations in natural killer (NK) - triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell distances were tracked and compared with terminally-profiled cellular transcriptomes. more...

3. Loss of SNAI1 induces cellular plasticity in invasive triple-negative breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) To investigate the effect of SNAI1 Knockout on development and growth of triple-negative human breast cancer cells The transcription factor SNAI1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fibroblast activation and controls inter-tissue migration. High SNAI1 expression characterizes metastatic triple-negative breast carcinomas, and its knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 uncovered establishment of an epithelio-mesenchymal phenotype accompanied by reduced signaling by the cytokine TGF-β. more...

4. Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Metastasis Suppressors NME1  and NME2 Modify Lipid Metabolism in Fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) Our aim was to understand how  vesicular NME1 and NME2 released by breast cancer cells influence the tumour microenvironment.  As a model, we used human invasive breast carcinoma cells overexpressing NME1 or NME2, and first  analysed in detail the presence of both isoforms in EV subtypes by capillaryWestern immunoassay  (WES) and immunoelectron microscopy. Data obtained by both methods showed that NME1 was  present in medium-sized EVs or microvesicles, whereas NME2 was abundant in both microvesicles  and small-sized EVs or exosomes. more...

5. Effects of LKB1/STK11 expression on MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pcDNA-vector or pcDNA-LKB1 were analyzed for changes in gene expression. Results provide insight into genes regulated by LKB1 signaling with implications in tumor and metastasis suppression in breast cancer.

6. Expression analysis of tumor microenvironment in triple-negative breast carcinoma in xenograft model
(Submitter supplied) Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family, exists and functions wholly within the tumor microenvironment to suppress tumorigenesis by directly targeting and antagonizing multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR and Met. This leads to potent and sustained signal attenuation, growth arrest, and angiostasis. We thus sought to evaluate the tumoricidal benefits of systemic decorin on a triple-negative orthotopic breast carcinoma xenograft model. more...
