7. Nitric oxide inhibits ten-eleven translocation DNA demethylase activity to regulate 5mC and 5hmC across the genome [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation at cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a heritable epigenetic mark that can regulate gene expression in health and disease. Enzymes that metabolize 5mC have been well-characterized yet the discovery of endogenously produced signaling molecules that regulate DNA methyl-modifying machinery have not been described. Herein, we report that the free radical signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) can directly inhibit the Fe(II)/2-OG-dependent DNA demethylases ten-eleven translocation (TET) and Human AlkB homolog 2 (ALKBH2). more...

9. TAZ is involved in breast cancer cell migration via regulating actin dynamics
(Submitter supplied) Background: Cancer metastasis is dependent on cell migration. Several mechanisms, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and actin fiber formation, could be involved in cancer cell migration. As a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, transcriptional coactivator with PDZbinding motif (TAZ) is recognized as a key mediator of the metastatic ability of breast cancer cells. We aimed to examine whether TAZ affects the migration of breast cancer cells through the regulation of EMT or actin cytoskeleton. more...

10. A scalable derivative-free optimizer trained through learning to optimize approach to interpret drug response mechanism network
(Submitter supplied) With the emergence of various drug-based treatment strategies, many drug response prediction models have been developed to understand their effects. However, in order to gain comprehensive understanding of a drug response, a prediction model should reflect the underlying biological mechanisms, but the current models suffer from interpretability and scalability problems. Machine learning-based prediction models base their predictions on inferred features, which usually are not well correlated with biological mechanisms, posing a challenge on interpretability of its response predictions. more...

43. LINC00115 promotes chemoresistant breast cancer stem-like cell stemness and metastasis through SETDB1/PLK3/HIF1α signaling [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Accumulated data demonstrate that cancer stem-like cell is a key barrier for therapeutic resistance and metastasis in various cancers, including breast cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Through a genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling, we identified that LINC00115 is robustly upregulated in chemoresistant breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). LINC00115 functions as a scaffold lncRNA to link SETDB1 and PLK3, leading to enhanced SETDB1 methylation of PLK3 at both K106 and K200 in drug-resistant BCSC. more...

44. Transcriptome analysis of doxorubicin-treated MCF7 breat cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Doxorubicin (DOX) is the most common chemotherapeutic drug used to treat breast cancer(BC), impairing DNA metabolism. We discovered that this drug induces, in breast cancer cells, the selective degradation of mitochondria suggesting that mitophagy could be a pro-survival path induced by DOX, hence favoring drug resistance. We anticipated that BC cells may avoid the effect of drug treatment by enhancing their mitophagy activity. more...

62. A continuous ferroptosis-to-apoptosis landscape identifies ferroptosis biomarkers and repressors for cancer therapy
(Submitter supplied) Ferroptosis, a cell death pathway driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in several human diseases including cancer. Although ferroptosis is entwined with apoptosis, it currently has no   characteristic biomarkers or gene signature. In this project we established a continuous phenotypic gradient between ferroptosis and apoptosis and coupled it to transcriptomic and metabolomic landscapes. Omics and mechanistic studies revealed that ferroptosis was associated with enhanced MITF activity, lysosomal function, glutaminolysis, TCA cycle, and activation of ATF4, while its transition into apoptosis was attributed to enhanced ER-stress, ATF4/CHOP switch and PE/PC metabolic shift. more...

76. Effects of a humanized CD47 antibody and SIRPα on triple negative breast carcinoma stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα, designated CD172a), also called SHPS-1 (SHP substrate 1) binds to CD47, a receptor for Thromobospondin-1 (TSP1). To block CD47-SIRP interaction, several CD47 blocking agents are in clinical trials. The purpose of this project is to explore the effects of SIRPFc signaling on bCSCs (breast cancer stem cells) derived from MDA-MB- 231 cells, when bCSCs were treated with either SIRPFc or CD47 blocking antibody CC90002 from Celgene Corporation.

81. Connective Tissue Growth Factor, a Potential Prognostic Marker of Triple Negative Breast Cancer treatment
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient with high level of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) show poor survival and prognosis. Identification of novel target contributes to the development of TNBC treatment. Kahweol, a coffee diterpene molecule, is a natural compound with pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic, and apoptotic effect in several cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of CTGF expression level in TNBC treatment. Experiments were performed on MDA-MB 231, a TNBC cell line. Firstly, functional annotation and gene set enrichment analysis found that the CTGF involves in migratory pathways in TNBC treatment. We also investigated that kahweol regulates CTGF expression and functions as antitumor compound resulting in inhibition of cell migration and colony formation in TNBC. Next, CTGF knockdown synergically suppressed cell motility with kahweol. Migratory ability and colony conformation were also performed in vitro to confirm the results from functional annotation assay. Overall, our results suggest that CTGF is a potential target as a prognostic marker predicting the prognosis of TNBC treatment, and kahweol is a potential antitumor compound to regulate CTGF expression for TNBC.

86. Evaluating genome-wide expression following the disruption of CDK12 reveals a bimodal pattern of gene regulation
(Submitter supplied) We demonstrate that the loss of CDK12 protein or activity, unlike CDK9 or CDK7, significantly upregulates the expression of certain genes, including genes whose activation contributes to the anti-proliferative effects of CDK12 inhibition. In HER2+ breast cancer, a malignancy where CDK12 is almost invariably co-amplified with HER2, CDK12 inhibition drives up the expression of MYC, which is toxic to HER2+ cancer cells. more...

91. Comprehensive Transcriptomic Analysis of EWSR1::WT1 Targets Identifies CDK4/6 Inhibitors as a Novel Therapeutic for Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor
(Submitter supplied) Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive, pediatric tumor characterized by the EWSR1::WT1 oncogene. Targeted therapies have not been developed and multimodal therapy is insufficient, leading to a 5-year survival rate of only 15-25%. Here, we deplete EWSR1::WT1 in DSRCT and for the first time establish its essentiality in vivo. Through transcriptomic analysis, we discover novel mechanistic insights into EWSR1::WT1 functionality including the uniqueness of its transcriptional alterations, the direct role of EWSR1::WT1 binding in gene upregulation, and the dominant role of the one of its two isoforms in transcription. more...

111. RNF20 contributes to epigenetic immunosuppression through CDK9-dependent LSD1 stablization (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) plays a critical role in transcription initiation and is essential for maintaining gene silencing at heterochromatic loci. Inhibition of CDK9 increases sensitivity to immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We now report that RNF20 stabilizes LSD1 via K29-mediated ubiquitination, which is dependent on CDK9-mediated phosphorylation. This CDK9- and RNF20-dependent LSD1 stabilization is necessary for the demethylation of histone H3K4, then subsequent repression of endogenous retrovirus (ERVs), and an interferon response, leading to epigenetic immunosuppression. more...

112. EVIDENCE OF STEADY-STATE FIBROBLAST SUBTYPES IN THE NORMAL HUMAN BREAST AS CELLS-OF-ORIGIN FOR PERTURBED-STATE FIBROBLASTS IN BREAST CANCER
(Submitter supplied) ABSTRACT Background:  Human breast cancer most frequently originates within a well-defined anatomical structure referred to as the terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU). This structure is endowed with its very own lobular fibroblasts representing one out of two steady-state fibroblast subtypes – the other being interlobular fibroblasts. While cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are increasingly appreciated as covering a spectrum of perturbed states, we lack a coherent understanding of their relationship – if any - with the steady-state fibroblast subtypes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Endocrine therapy is the most important treatment modality of breast cancer patients whose tumors express the estrogen receptor  (ER).  The androgen receptor (AR) is also expressed in the vast majority (80-90%) of ER-positive tumors. However, AR-targeting drugs are not used in clinical practice, but have been evaluated in multiple trials and preclinical studies. We performed a genome-wide study to identify genetic context-dependent AR signaling induced by either AR agonist (dihydrotestosterone [DHT]), or AR antagonist (enzalutamide [Enz]), known as pharmacogenomic expression quantitative expression loci (PGx-eQTLs), utilizing a previously well characterized lymphoblastic cell line panel.

(Submitter supplied) Oxidation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4ox) is catalyzed by lysyl oxidase–like 2 (LOXL2). This histone modification is enriched in heterochromatin in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and has been linked to the maintenance of compacted chromatin. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this maintenance is still unknown. Here we show that LOXL2 interacts with RUVBL1, RUVBL2, BAF53, and DMAP1, a complex involved in the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z. more...

147. RAGE/SNAIL signaling drives Epithelial-Mesenchymal plasticity in metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Epithelial-Mesenchymal plasticity plays a fundamental role both in embryogenesis and in tumor cell dissemination during tumor progression. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a driver of cell plasticity in fibrotic diseases; however, its role and molecular mechanism in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that RAGE signaling maintains the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive TNBC cells by enforcing the expression of SNAIL. more...

150. TRPS1 modulates chromatin accessibility to regulate estrogen receptor (ER) binding and ER target gene expression in luminal breast cancer cells (3 clone PRO-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. The most common subtype is luminal breast cancer, which is typically driven by estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a transcription factor (TF) that activates many genes required for proliferation. Multiple effective therapies target this pathway, but individuals often develop resistance. Thus, there is a need to identify additional targets that regulate ER activity and contribute to breast tumor progression. more...

163. Nuclear export of circular RNA
(Submitter supplied) Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which can function as regulators of gene expression, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus. circRNAs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here, we uncover a pathway specific for nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, Exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. Enhancing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient by depletion or chemical inhibition of the major protein exporter, CRM1, selectively increases nuclear export of circRNAs, while reducing the nuclear Ran-GTP gradient selectively blocks circRNA export. more...

(Submitter supplied) Regulator of chromosome condensation domain-containing protein 1 (RCCD1) plays an important role in chromosome segregation and microtubule stability in the nucleus and has been identified recently as a potential driver for breast cancer. We report here that, unexpectedly, RCCD1 is also localized in mitochondria. We show that RCCD1 resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with the mitochondrial contact site/cristae organizing system (MICOS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to regulate mitochondrial nucleoid organization, thereby influencing mtDNA transcription, oxidative phosphorylation, and the production of reactive oxygen species. more...

185. Analysis of plasma small RNAs prior to breast cancer diagnosis
(Submitter supplied) Overabundance of circulating RNY transcripts and fragments has been associated with cancer. Here we analyzed the levels of RNYs in plasma collected from women before developing breast cancer and compared the results to matched controls that remained unaffected. Using small RNA-seq, two cohorts were analyzed: a cohort of women carriers of pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, and diagnosed with breast cancer as a first neoplasm within a period of < 12 months after blood test (n = 11), or that provided a blood sample at a similar age and remained unaffected (n = 13); and a cohort from a long-term prospective study, and comprising 8 sporadic breast cancer cases (diagnosed in a period of < 12 months after blood test) and 8 controls matched for individual and epidemiological variables

187. MYC enhancer invasion promotes prognostic cancer type-specific gene programs through an epigenetic switch [CAGE-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor MYC is overexpressed in most cancers, where it drives multiple hallmarks of cancer progression. MYC is known to promote oncogenic transcription by binding to active promoters. In addition, MYC has also been shown to invade distal enhancers when expressed at oncogenic levels, but this enhancer binding has been proposed to have low gene-regulatory potential. Here, we demonstrate that MYC enhancer binding directly promotes cancer type-specific gene programs predictive of poor patient prognosis. more...

191. Nuclear export of circular RNA
(Submitter supplied) Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are increasingly being implicated in a variety of functions in normal and cancerous cells1-5, are formed by back-splicing of precursor mRNAs in the nucleus6-10. circRNAs are predom¬inantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that they must be exported from the nucleus. Here, we uncover a pathway specific for nuclear export of circular RNA. This pathway requires Ran-GTP, Exportin-2 and IGF2BP1. more...

194. Transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism by KDM2B, in the context of ncPRC1.1 and in concert with MYC and ATF4 [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) KDM2B encodes a JmjC domain-containing histone lysine demethylase, which functions as an oncogene in several types of tumors, including TNBC. This study was initiated to address the cancer relevance of the results of our earlier work, which had shown that overexpression of KDM2B renders mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resistant to oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant mechanisms.  Methods We mainly employed a multi-omics strategy consisting of RNA-Seq, quantitative TMT proteomics, Mass-spectrometry-based global metabolomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-seq, to explore the role of KDM2B in the resistance to oxidative stress and intermediary metabolism. more...

200. AS1842856 treatment in BT549 cells
(Submitter supplied) Basal-like breast cancer (BBC) is a poor prognosis cancer that lacks effective targeted therapy. Recently our group and others found that forkhead box transcription factor FOXO1 promotes stem gene expression in BBC and GBM cell lines. Given the critical role of cancer stem cells in promoting cancer progression, we examined the impact of FOXO1 inhibition with AS1842856 on BBC cells. We treated BT549 cells with 200nM AS1842856 for 48 hours and found that FOXO1 inhibition induced a set of WNT Pathway genes.

225. MTOR modulation induces selective perturbations in histone methylation which influence the anti-proliferative effects of mTOR inhibitors [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Emerging data suggest a significant cross-talk between metabolic and epigenetic programs. However, the relationship between the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) which is a pivotal regulator of cellular metabolism, and epigenetic modifications remains poorly understood. We thus explored the impact of modulating mTOR signaling on histone methylation, a well-known epigenetic modification. Our results show that constitutive mTORC1 activation caused by abrogation of TSC2 increases H3K27me3 but not H3K4me3 or H3K9me3, via 4E-BPs-mediated induction of EZH2 protein levels. more...

228. Effect of long-term education with EVs from women with obesity on MCF7 gene expression
(Submitter supplied) Breast adipose tissue is an important contributor to the obesity-breast cancer link.  Dysregulated cell metabolism is now an accepted hallmark of cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized particles containing selective cargo, such as miRNAs, that act locally or circulate to distant sites to modulate target cell functions. Here, we found that long-term education of breast cancer cells (MCF7, T47D) with EVs obtained from breast adipose tissue of women who are overweight or obese (O-EVs) leads to sustained increased proliferative potential. more...

257. MUC1-C integrates induction of aerobic glycolysis with suppression of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer stem cells
(Submitter supplied) The MUC1-C protein evolved in mammals for adaptation of barrier tissues to loss of homeostasis. Prolonged activation of MUC1-C in settings of chronic inflammation promotes lineage plasticity, epigenetic reprogramming and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. The effects of MUC1-C on the metabolism of CSCs remain unexplored. The present studies performed on purified populations of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) CSCs demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates the capacity for self-renewal with the activation of aerobic glycolysis. more...

(Submitter supplied) We previously showed that the germ cell specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility. RBMXL2 evolved from the X-linked RBMX gene, which is silenced during meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. It has been unknown whether RBMXL2 provides a direct replacement for RBMX in meiosis, or whether RBMXL2 evolved to deal with the transcriptionally permissive environment of meiosis. more...

299. Modeling the nascent RNA transcriptome with chrTT-seq to extract chromatin dissociation dynamics on newly transcribed RNA.
(Submitter supplied) To capture chromatin dissociation dynamics of nascent RNA transcripts we labeled MCF-7 cells with 4-thio-uridine (4-SU) for 8 minutes, then chased with an excess of uridine for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min. At each pulse-chase time point we performed TT-seq from the chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic fraction. The ratios of spike-in normalized chromatin-associated to chromatin-released nascent RNA read coverage over genomic features (transcripts' last exons) were fitted on an exponential decay function to extract an estimated chromatin association half-live time for each transcript.

313. RNF8 ubiquitylation of XRN2 facilitates R-loop resolution and restrains genomic instability in BRCA1 mutant cells 
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer linked with BRCA1/2 mutations commonly recur and resist current therapies, including PARP inhibitors. Given the lack of effective targeted therapies for BRCA1-mutant cancers, we sought to identify novel targets to selectively kill these cancers. Here, we report that loss of RNF8 significantly protects Brca1-mutant mice against mammary tumorigenesis. RNF8 deficiency in human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells was found to promote R-loop accumulation and replication fork instability, leading to increased DNA damage, senescence, and synthetic lethality. more...

328. Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation in Lobular Breast Cancer is Associated with Reduced Cell Proliferation and Promotion of Metastases; SUM44-GR-GFP
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) comprises about ~15% of breast cancer.  ILC’s unique genotypic (loss of wild type E-cadherin expression) and phenotypic (small individual round cancer cells that grow in discontinuous nests) are thought to contribute to a distinctive pattern of metastases to serosal membranes. Unlike invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), ILC metastases often intercalate into the mesothelial layer of the peritoneum and other serosal surfaces. more...

Although intra-clonal interactions between co-existing lineages is emerging as major contributor shaping tumor evolution, the extent and nature of interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Allee effect, i.e., growth dependency on population size, is pervasive, and that intra-clonal soluble metabolite exchange alleviates the Allee thresholds to growth. more...

345. FBXL12 degrades FANCD2 to regulate replication recovery and promote cancer cell survival under conditions of replication stress
(Submitter supplied) Oncogene-induced replication stress constitutes an early obstacle for pre-cancerous cells to overcome to progress towards malignancy. Fanconi anaemia signalling represents a major genomic maintenance pathway that is activated in response to replication stress, impinging on stalled replication fork stability and recovery. Here, we report that upon replication stress, phosphorylation of the FANCD2 N-terminus by CHK1 triggers FBXL12-dependent proteasomal degradation of FANCD2, facilitating clearance of FANCD2 at stalled replication forks. more...

346. A Cleavage Product METTL3a-(238-580) Mediates m6A Methyltransferase Complex Assembly and mTOR Activation
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of mRNA by the methyltransferase complex (MTC), with core components including METTL3-METTL14 heterodimers and Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), contributes to breast tumorigenesis, but the mechanism of MTC assembly remains elusive. Here, we identify a novel cleaved form METTL3a (residues 239-580 of METTL3), that is highly expressed in breast cancer. Furthermore, we find that both METTL3a and full-length METTL3 are required for MTC assembly, RNA m6A deposition, as well as cancer cell proliferation. more...

347. Role of EGR1 in vasculogenic mimicry of MDA-MB-231 cells
(Submitter supplied) Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is an intriguing phenomenon observed in tumor masses, in which cancer cells organize themselves into capillary-like channels that closely resemble the structure and function of blood vessels. Although VM is believed to contribute to alternative tumor vascularization, the detailed regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes remain poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the role of Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) in regulating VM in aggressive cancer cells, specifically MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.

Several studies have shown that the presence of TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment contributes to the skewing of neutrophils to have a more pro-tumor phenotype. However, the direct effects of TGF-β on neutrophil signaling and migration are unclear. We sought to characterize TGF-β signaling in both primary human neutrophils and the neutrophil-like cell line HL-60 and determine whether TGF-β directly induces neutrophil migration. more...

(Submitter supplied) Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib has been shown to synergize in vitro with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) in reducing the viability of cells derived from B-cell malignancies, but the mechanism is not known. We report here that an off-target effect of Ibrutinib causes synergy because not all BTK inhibitors exhibited the synergistic effect, and those that synergized did so even in cells that do not express BTK. more...

(Submitter supplied) HDAC3 and HDAC8 are members of class I deacetylases involved in several biological mechanisms and represent a highly sought-after therapeutic target for drug development. It is historically challenging to develop selective deacetylase inhibitors due to their conserved catalytic domains. HDAC3 also has deacetylase-independent activity, which cannot be blocked by conventional enzymatic inhibitors. Recent advance in proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) provides an opportunity to eliminate the whole protein selectively, abolishing both enzymatic and scaffolding function. more...

402. An EZH2-NF-kB Regulatory Axis Drives Expression of Pro-Oncogenic Genetic Signatures in TNBC
(Submitter supplied) EZH2 has been studied most extensively in the context of PRC2-dependent gene repression. Paradoxically, accumulating evidence indicates non-canonical functions for EZH2 in cancer contexts including promoting gene expression in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells through interactions with the transcription factor NF-kB.  We define a genomic profile of EZH2 and NF-kB factor RelA, RelB, and NFKB2/p52 co-localization and positive regulation of a subset of NF-kB targets and genes associated with oncogenic functions in TNBC, which is enriched in patient datasets. more...

422. TRPS1 modulates chromatin accessibility to regulate estrogen receptor (ER) binding and ER target gene expression in luminal breast cancer cells (Time course PRO-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. The most common subtype is luminal breast cancer, which is typically driven by the estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a transcription factor (TF) that activates many genes required for proliferation. Multiple effective therapies target this pathway, but individuals often develop resistance. Thus, there is a need to identify additional targets that regulate ER activity and contribute to breast tumor progression. more...

512. A tumor microenvironment-driven network regulated by STAT3 and p65 controls the enrichment of cancer stem cells in human HR+/HER2- breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) The high incidence of the HR+/HER2- breast cancer subtype is a major public health concern, leading us to explore the way three arms of the tumor microenvironment (TME) – hormonal, inflammatory and growth-stimulating – affect tumor progression in this disease. Our past findings indicate that such a joint “TME Stimulation” induces pro-metastatic traits in HR+/HER2- cells, primarily enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs), playing key roles in metastasis in vivo. more...

548. N-acetylcysteine overcomes NF1-loss driven resistance to PI3K alpha inhibition in breast cancer [T47D RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The aim of our study was to investigate PIK3CA collaborative mutations that result in resistance to BYL719, a PI3Kα selective inhibitor. One of the tumor suppressor genes discovered was neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Using shRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of NF1 in murine and human PIK3CAH1047R cell lines and a patient derived xenograft organoid model, we found that NF1 loss reduces sensitivity to PI3Kα inhibition. more...

562. PI3Kβ controls immune evasion in PTEN-deficient breast tumors
(Submitter supplied) Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor is one of the most common oncogenic drivers across all cancer types. PTEN is the major negative regulator of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling. Notably, the PI3Kβ isoform has been shown to play an important role in PTEN-deficient tumors, but the mechanisms underlying the importance of PI3Kβ activity remain elusive. Using a syngeneic genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of invasive breast cancer driven by concurrent ablation of Pten and Trp53 (p53), we showed that genetic inactivation of PI3Kβ led to a robust anti-tumor immune response that abrogated tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, but not in immunodeficient mice. more...

586. Menin is a ‘reader’ of histone H3 lysine 79 methylation (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Methylation of histone H3 lysine-79 is an epigenetic mark for gene regulation in development, cellular differentiation and disease progression. However, it remains poorly understood how this histone mark is translated into downstream effects due to the lack of knowledge of H3K79 methylation ‘readers’. Here, we develop a nucleosome-based photoaffinity probe to capture proteins that recognize H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) in nucleosomal context. more...

622. A truncated and catalytically inactive isoform of KDM5B histone demethylase accumulates in breast cancer cells and regulates H3K4 tri-methylation and gene expression
(Submitter supplied) KDM5B histone demethylase is overexpressed in many cancers and plays an ambivalent role in oncogenesis, depending on the specific context. This ambivalence could be explained by the expression of KDM5B protein isoforms with diverse functional roles, which could be present at different levels in various cancer cell lines. We show here that one of these isoforms, namely KDM5B-NTT, accumulates in breast cancer cell lines due to remarkable protein stability relative to the canonical PLU-1 isoform, which shows a much faster turnover. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor FOXA1, which functions in epigenetic reprogramming, plays a critical role in breast cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FOXA1 achieves its oncogenic functions remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the O-GlcNAcylation of FOXA1 increases breast cancer metastasis capacity by orchestrating the transcription of numerous metastasis regulators. O-GlcNAcylation at Thr432, Ser441 and Ser443 regulates the stability of FOXA1 and promotes its assembly with chromatin in breast cancer cells. more...

661. Identification of a novel ER-NFκB driven stem-like cell population associated with poor outcome of ER+ breast cancer patients
(Submitter supplied) Up to 40% of patients with Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer experience relapse. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are known to be involved in therapy resistance, relapse, and development of more aggressive and metastatic tumors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify genes/pathways that drive stem-like cell properties in ER+ breast tumors. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatic approaches, with additional follow-up studies, we identified a unique quiescent stem-like cell population that is driven by ER and NFkB in multiple ER+ breast cancer models. more...

663. Arginine methylation of BRD4 by PRMT2/4 governs transcription and DNA repair
(Submitter supplied) BRD4 functions as an epigenetic reader and plays a crucial role in regulating transcription and genome stability. Dysregulation of BRD4 is frequently observed in various human cancers. However, the molecular details of BRD4 regulation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that PRMT2- and PRMT4-mediated arginine methylation is pivotal for BRD4-dependent transcription, DNA repair, and tumor growth. Specifically, PRMT2/4 interact with and methylates BRD4 at R179, R181, and R183. This arginine methylation selectively controls a transcriptional program by promoting BRD4 enrichment at the hyper-acetylated chromatin regions. Moreover, BRD4 arginine methylation is induced by DNA damage and thereby promotes its binding to chromatin for DNA repair. Deficiency in BRD4 arginine methylation significantly suppresses tumor growth and sensitizes cells to BET inhibitors and DNA damaging agents. Therefore, our findings reveal an arginine methylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of BRD4 function and highlight targeting PRMT2/4 for better anti-tumor effect of BET inhibitors and DNA damaging agents.

697. Transcriptomics indicate nuclear division and cell adhesion not recapitulated in MCF7 and MCF10A compared to luminal A breast tumours
(Submitter supplied) To better understand the tumour-modelling efficacy of cell lines, we performed RNA-seq analyses on 2D and 3D cultures of tumourigenic MCF7 and non-tumourigenic MCF10A and augmented our data with published datasets. To our knowledge, this was the first RNA-seq dataset comprising 2D and 3D cultures of MCF7 and MCF10A within the same experiment. We then compared tumourigenesis within cell lines (MCF7-vs-MCF10A) and tumourigenesis within clinical tissues (Luminal A-vs-Normal) from the TCGA-BRCA dataset and considered whether the same cancer-related processes could be observed.

(Submitter supplied) Solid tumors are highly refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies due to the functional impairment of the effector T cells and its trafficking back to the tumor. The T cell activation is negatively regulated by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), however, the exact mechanism of CSK’s T cell-restraining activity remains unknown. Here, we show that the primeval oncogenic tyrosine kinase, ACK1 dampens T-cell response by augmenting CSK activity through a novel Tyr18-phosphorylation. more...

770. On-treatment transcriptional profiling in HER2+ inflammatory breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and understudied disease, with 40% of cases presenting with HER2-positive IBC. Within a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with HER2-positive IBC, we sought to (i) assess the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of short-term neoadjuvant dual-HER2-blockade and paclitaxel, (ii) define baseline and on-treatment transcriptional profiles of tumor biopsies that are associated with pCR, and (iii) identify biologic pathways that may explain the effect of neoadjuvant therapy on pathologic tumor response.

771. Comparative single-cell genomics uncovers evolutionarily conserved features and therapeutic targets in triple-negative breast cancer fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) We performed scRNA-seq analysis of fibroblasts from murine and human TNBCs. We observed three CAF subtypes in mouse TNBC: two transcriptionally distinct CAFs that were found intermingled and adjacent to tumor cells, and distal CAFs that were located further away from tumor cells. All three CAFs appear to evolve from normal resident fibroblasts/pericytes by activation of Pdgf and Tgfb receptors in fibroblasts in parallel with reciprocal upregulation of ligands in tumor cells and other tumor microenvironment cells. more...

773. HMGN5 escorts oncogenic STAT3 signaling by regulating chromatin landscape in tumorigenesis of breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic alterations are widely linked with carcinogenesis, therefore becoming emerging therapeutic targets in the treatment of cancers, including breast cancer. HMGNs are nucleosome binding proteins, which regulate chromatin structures in a cell type- and disease-specific manner. However, the roles of HMGNs in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer are less known. In this study, we report that HMGNs are highly expressed in 3D-cultured breast cancer cells. more...

Herein, we show that upregulation of CDK6, p-CDK2, and/or cyclin E1 is associated with adaptation and resistance to AI-monotherapy and combined CDK4/6i and ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer. more...

813. Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Molecular Features in Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a nonobligate precursor of invasive breast cancer. Its biological features, particularly its intratumoral heterogeneity, remain obscure. Moreover, mechanism of lymph node metastasis is unclear. To address this deficiency, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of DCIS, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and lymph node metastasis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that breast cancer exhibits intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional level, defining specific functions, and that DCIS has similar heterogeneity to IDC.

817. FGFR inhibition reverses resistance to endocrine therapy by reducing expression of EMT-related genes
(Submitter supplied) Background: Up to 40% of patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer experience treatment resistance and disease recurrence, often caused by the upregulation of growth factor receptors. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets is, therefore, of vital importance if breast cancer prognosis is to be further improved. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a potential driver of endocrine resistance; however, clinically successful attempts at targeting FGFR1 activity in breast cancer are rare and may result from an inability to correctly identify patients that could benefit from such treatment. more...

845. PARP1-SNAI2 Transcription Axis Drives Resistance to PARP Inhibitor, Talazoparib (scRNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The synthetic lethal association between BRCA deficiency and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition supports PARP inhibitor (PARPi) clinical efficacy in BRCA-mutated tumors. PARPis also demonstrate activity in non-BRCA mutated tumors presumably through induction of PARP1-DNA trapping. Despite pronounced clinical response, therapeutic resistance to PARPis inevitably develops. An abundance of knowledge has been built around resistance mechanisms in BRCA-mutated tumors, however, parallel understanding in non-BRCA mutated settings remains insufficient. more...

880. Overlapping and distinct functions between ERα and ERβ homodimers and corresponding transcriptomes in the same cellular context
(Submitter supplied) The two estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ function as ligand-inducible transcription factors. Most in vitro studies have reported that ERα drives breast cancer growth whereas ERβ, if expressed, suppresses growth. To dissect function and gene expression profile regulated by ERα or ERβ, respectively, we generated a novel cell model expressing only ERβ, by applying CRISPR-cas9 to delete ERα in MCF7 cells with stable Tet-Off-inducible ERβ expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) During radiotherapy most cancer cells are removed, but some cells are not. These remained cancer cells become resistant to radiotherapy and lead to cancer recurrence. Radioresistnat cancer cells show different gene expression profile than radiosensitive tumor cells. Among the genes distinctly up or down-changed in expression level, some are associated with development of radioresistance. We used microarrays to select multiple genes showing distinct change in expression level for seeking genes that contribute to the develpoment of radioresistance in breast cancer cells during radiotherapy.

916. Rad21 is the core subunit of cohesin complex in directing genome organization
(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotes, the nuclear chromatin in the interphase is a hierarchical organization. Previous studies have suggested that cohesin-DNA interactions play important architectural functions for chromatin structure in the interphase. In this study, we applied super-resolution imaging, single-molecule imaging to measure the distribution of cohesin subunits. Hi-C and RNA-seq were used to reveal the 3D genome structures alterations and the relationship with breast cancer upon Rad21 up-regulation. more...

917. The whole transcriptional landscape of circulating tumor cells compared to metastases in stage IV breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is responsible for the vast majority of breast cancer related deaths. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is inherently different than primary breast cancer (BC), evolving under selection pressure at different organ sites or during systemic therapy.   The current ASCO guidelines call for biopsy of a metastatic site to guide decision making for systemic therapy. Yet, biopsies of macro metastasis are  oftentimes not feasible in the clinical setting. more...

928. The metastatic spread of breast cancer accelerates during sleep
(Submitter supplied) The metastatic spread of cancer is achieved by the haematogenous dissemination of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). Generally, however, the temporal dynamics that dictate the generation of metastasis-competent CTCs are largely uncharacterized, and it is often assumed that CTCs are constantly shed from growing tumours or are shed as a consequence of mechanical insults1. Here we observe a striking and unexpected pattern of CTC generation dynamics in both patients with breast cancer and mouse models, highlighting that most spontaneous CTC intravasation events occur during sleep. more...

952. The histone variant macroH2A1.1 regulates RNA Polymerase II paused genes within defined chromatin interaction landscapes.
(Submitter supplied) The histone variant macroH2A1.1 plays a role in cancer development and metastasis. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we mapped the genome-wide localization of endogenous macroH2A1.1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231. We demonstrate that macroH2A1.1 specifically binds to active promoters and enhancers in addition to facultative heterochromatin. Selective knock-down of macroH2A1.1 deregulates expression of hundreds of highly active genes. more...

953. PHGDH heterogeneity potentiates cancer cell dissemination and metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Cancer metastasis requires the transient activation of cellular programs enabling dissemination and seeding in distant organs. Genetic, transcriptional and translational heterogeneity contributes to this dynamic process. Metabolic heterogeneity has also been observed, yet its role for cancer progression is less explored. Here, we discover that loss of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) potentiates metastatic dissemination. more...

954. Effect of miR-200c-3p overexpression on primary human macrophages
(Submitter supplied) Macrophages constitute a major part of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells and within the tumor microenvironment acquire an alternatively activated, tumor-supporting phenotype. Factors released by tumor cells are crucial for the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. In the present project, we aimed to understand the role of miR-200c in the interplay between tumor cells and macrophages. To this end, we employed a coculture system of MCF7 breast tumor cells and primary human macrophages and observed a substantial transfer of miR-200c from apoptotic tumor cells to macrophages, which required intact CD36 receptor in macrophages. more...

955. RhoA-ROCK competes with YAP to regulate amoeboid breast cancer cell migration in response to lymphatic-like flow
(Submitter supplied) Lymphatic drainage generates force that induces prostate cancer cell motility via activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), but whether this response to fluid force is conserved across cancer types is unclear. Here, we show that shear stress corresponding to fluid flow in the initial lymphatics modifies taxis in breast cancer. Whereas some cell lines employ rapid amoeboid migration behavior in response to fluid flow, a separate subset decrease movement. more...

Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 synergistically limits TNBC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LOXL2 interacts in the nucleus with the short isoform of BRD4 (BRD4S), MED1, and the cell cycle transcriptional regulator B-MyB. more...

Herein we define lysosomal acid lipase A (LIPA) as a viable molecular target in TNBC and identify a stereospecific small molecule (ERX-41) that binds LIPA. ERX-41 induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulting in cell death, and this effect is on target as evidenced by specific LIPA mutations providing resistance. more...

970. RNAseq analysis of human macrophages differentiated from monocytes exposed to extracellular vesicles from tumor cells or recombinant CSF-1
(Submitter supplied) Tumor  associated  macrophages  (TAMs),  which  differentiate  from  circulating  monocytes,  are pervasive across human cancers and comprise heterogeneous populations. The contribution of tumor-derived signals to TAM heterogeneity is not well understood. In particular, tumors release both soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose respective impact on TAM precursors may be different. Here, we show that triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) release EVs and soluble  molecules  promoting  monocyte  differentiation  towards  distinct  macrophage  fates.

(Submitter supplied) While estrogen receptor positive breast tumors generally respond well to endocrine therapy (ET), up to 40% of patients will experience relapse, either while on endocrine therapy or after ET is completed. We have previously shown that the selective pressure of tamoxifen activates the pro-survival NFkB pathway in patient tumors, breast cancer cell lines, and breast cancer xenograft tumors, and that this activation allows for survival of a population of ET-tolerant cells, which can contribute to relapse after ET withdrawal. more...

ADARs play important roles in development and disease, and previous work has shown that ADAR1 is oncogenic in a growing list of cancer types. Here we show that ADAR1 is important for growth and invasion in triple negative breast cancer cells, as ADAR1 loss yields reduced growth, migration & invasion, and mammosphere formation. more...

However, how aerobic glycolysis is directly regulated is largely unknown. Here, we show that ectopic Zeb1 directly increases the transcriptional expression of HK2, PFKP and PKM2, which are glycolytic rate-determining enzymes, thus promoting the Warburg effect and breast cancer proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. more...

1024. WNT11/ROR2 signaling is associated with tumor invasion and poor survival in breast cancer [patients]
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with more than two million new cases diagnosed in 2018. Patients frequently develop metastases in the course of their disease which limit survival due to the lack of a curative treatment. One signaling pathway that is frequently involved in cancer initiation and progression is the WNT pathway. Breast cancer has been associated with activation of the WNT signaling pathway, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. more...

1059. GATA3 truncation mutants alter EMT related gene expression via partial motif recognition in luminal breast cancer cell
(Submitter supplied) GATA3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer. The roles of GATA3 mutations remain elusive. In this study, we characterized newly established luminal breast cancer cell lines that stably express different GATA3 patient-derived mutants (Splice site deletion, C321 frame-shift, and A333 frame-shift mutants). The expression of these mutants lead to altered expression of  EMT related genes as well as redistribution of GATA3.

1154. Small molecule RBI2 disrupts ribosome biogenesis through pre-rRNA depletion
(Submitter supplied) In all domains of life, the rate of protein synthesis is directly linked to the rates of cell growth and proliferation. Consequently, highly proliferative cancer cells are especially sensitive to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis. While ribosome synthesis and cancer have a well-established relationship, only recently has ribosome biogenesis drawn interest as a cancer therapeutic target. Here, we have exploited the relationship between ribosome biogenesis and cancer cell proliferation by using a potent ribosome biogenesis inhibitor: RBI2 (Ribosome Biogenesis Inhibitor 2) to perturb cancer cell growth and viability.  We demonstrate that RBI2 significantly decreases cell viability in malignant melanoma cells and breast cancer cell lines. more...

1156. CTI-2 inhibits metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells by modulating MAPK signaling pathway
(Submitter supplied) Although some breast cancer patients die due to tumor metastasis rather than from the primary tumor, the molecular mechanism of metastasis remains unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to inhibit breast cancer metastasis during cancer treatment. In this case, after designing and synthesizing CTI-2, we found that CTI-2 treatment significantly reduced breast cancer cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Notably, with the treatment of CTI-2 in breast cancer cells, the expression level of E-cadherin increased, while the expression level of N-cadherin and vimentin decreased. In addition, after CTI-2 treatment, those outflow levels for p-ERK, p-p38, and p-JNK diminished, while no significant changes in the expression levels of ERK, JNK, or p38 were observed. Our conclusion suggested that CTI-2 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast carcinoma cells by inhibiting the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the metastasis of breast tumor cells. Therefore, we believe that CTI-2 is another candidate for breast tumor medication.

1231. Reactivation of Tumor Suppressor in Breast Cancer by Enhancer Switching through NamiRNA Network
(Submitter supplied) We reported that low expression of miRNA in cancer as a recognized signature leads to loss function of TSGs in breast cancer. In 157 paired breast cancer and adjacent normal samples, tumour suppressor gene GPER1 and miR-339 are both downregulated in Luminal A/B and Triple Negative Breast Cancer subtypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that that miR-339 upregulates GPER1 expression in breast cancer cells by switching on the GPER1 enhancer, which can be blocked by enhancer deletion through the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

(Submitter supplied) PARP inhibitor and platinum based drugs such as cisplatin are promising therapies for triple negative breast cancer and exploit the deficiencies in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or homologous recombination repair defects. However, PARP inhibitor resistance is proven to be a major clinical problem. Acquired PARP inhibitor resistance has been linked with co-resistance to platinum-based drugs.  To determine how acquired olaparib resistance affects cisplatin response and whether this is influenced by their BRCA1 status, we performed RNAseq transcriptome analysis of isogenic triple negative breast cancer models of olaparib resistance with normal and mutant BRCA1.

1305. Unique integrated stress response sensors regulate cancer cell susceptibility when Hsp70 activity is compromised
(Submitter supplied) Molecular chaperones prevent the accumulation of toxic proteins in the cell, but when chaperones are overwhelmed, the rapid modulation of proteostasis pathways provide corrective responses. One molecular chaperone in particular, Hsp70, plays a central role in both cellular protection and the response to proteotoxic insults. This is perhaps most evident in cancer cells, some of which overexpress Hsp70 and thrive even when harboring high levels of misfolded, aggregated, and/or unassembled protein complexes. more...

1309. Breast tumor stiffness instructs bone metastasis via mechanical memory
(Submitter supplied) The mechanical microenvironment of primary breast tumors plays a substantial role in promoting tumor progression. While the transitory response of cancer cells to pathological stiffness in their native microenvironment has been well described, it is unclear whether mechanical stimuli in the primary tumor influence distant, late-stage metastatic phenotypes in absentia. Here, we show that primary tumor stiffness promotes stable yet non-genetically heritable phenotypes in breast cancer cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) R-loops, which consist of a DNA/RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of chromatin biology. R-loops are particularly enriched at gene promoters, where they play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that control promoter-associated R-loops remain unclear. The epigenetic “reader” Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3), which recognizes methylarginine marks on histones and on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, was previously shown to recruit DNA topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) to relax negatively supercoiled DNA and prevent R-loop formation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Using the TSG101 pre-mRNA, we previously discovered cancer-specific re-splicing of mature mRNA that generates aberrant transcripts/proteins.  The fact that mRNA is aberrantly re-spliced in various cancer cells implies there must be an important mechanism to prevent deleterious re-splicing on the spliced mRNA in normal cells.  We thus postulated that the mRNA re-splicing is controlled by specific repressors and we searched for repressor candidates by siRNA-based screening for mRNA re-splicing activity. more...

1340. Tubacin mediates the synthetic lethality of cysteine in breast cancer independent on HDAC6
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a highly aggressive nature and distinct molecular characteristics from other subtypes of breast cancer and lacks effective targeted therapy. The molecular and genetic basis of cysteine/cystine dependency in TNBC is complex. We found that cysteine addiction associates with the expression of a set of Claudin genes in TNBC. The Claudin-high TNBCs are independent on cystine, while the Claudin-low TNBCs undergo rapid ferroptosis upon cystine deprivation or inhibition of cystine transport by erastin. more...

1399. The RNA Atlas expands the catalog of human non-coding RNAs
(Submitter supplied) The human transcriptome consists of various RNA biotypes including multiple types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Current ncRNA compendia remain incomplete partially because they are almost exclusively derived from the interrogation of small- and polyadenylated RNAs. Here, we present a more comprehensive atlas of the human transcriptome that is derived from matching polyA-, total-, and small-RNA profiles of a heterogenous collection of nearly 300 human tissues and cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) Splicing is a central RNA-based process commonly altered in human cancers; however, how the splicing machinery is co-opted during tumorigenesis remains largely unresolved. Here we identify the splice factor SF3A3 at the nexus of an oncogenic translation program that rewires splicing to promote tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that key spliceosomal networks centered on the essential core U2-associated factor, SF3A3, are exquisitely controlled at the translation level during oncogenic stress. more...

(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidence suggested that epigenetic regulators can exhibit both co-activator and co-repressor activities in gene transcriptional regulation and disease development, such as cancer. However, how these dual activities are regulated and coordinated in cellular contexts remains elusive. Here, we reported that KDM5C, a repressive histone demethylase, is unexpectedly required for estrogen/estrogen receptor alpha (ERa)-induced gene transcriptional activation to promote cell proliferation, while it suppresses the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to escape from immuno-surveillance. more...

Importantly, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) expands with aging and obesity- two key risk factors in multiple myeloma (MM) disease prevalence- suggesting that BMAs influence and are influenced by myeloma cells in the marrow. Here we examined how myeloma cells affect adipocytes and provide evidence that MM cells alter adipocyte gene expression and cytokine secretion profiles, creating a “MM-associated” adipocyte (MM-adipocyte) phenotype. more...

Mutations of ASXL1 occur in multiple myeloid neoplasms and are uniformly associated with poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism through which ASXL1 mutations alter BAP1 activity to drive leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that cancer-associated frame-shift ASXL1 mutations, which were originally proposed to act as destabilizing loss-of-function mutations, in fact encode truncated stable gain-of-function proteins. more...

1433. HIF-1 Recruits TRIM28 and DNA-PK to Release Paused RNA Polymerase II and Activate Target Gene Transcription in Response to Hypoxia
(Submitter supplied) Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of O2 homeostasis in metazoan species by binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and activating the transcription of hundreds of genes in response to reduced O2 availability. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiates transcription of many HIF target genes under non-hypoxic conditions, but pauses after 20-100 nucleotides and requires HIF-1 binding for release. more...

1461. Suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating FZD1 under hypoxia
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer (BrCa) deaths; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we report that suppression of MBD2 alternative splicing under hypoxia, which favors the production of MBD2a, facilitates BrCa metastasis. Specifically, we found that MBD2a promotes, whereas its less-known short form MBD2c suppresses metastasis. We elucidate that HIF-1 activation under hypoxia facilitates MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing and, as a result, the elevated MBD2a outcompetes MBD2c for binding to the promoter CpG islands to activate the expression of FZD1, thereby promoting EMT and metastasis. more...

1467. Next Generation Sequencing of MDA-MB-231 cells with variable subcellular localization of Aurora-A Kinase (Wild-type (WT), no localization signal sequence, Cytoplasmic (NES) or Nuclear (NLS)) .
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine a specific gene expression profile of Nuclear Aurora-A Kinase expressing cells. It has been previously shown that AURKA localizes to the nucleus in patient biopsies in multiple aggressive malignancies including breast cancer but functional significance of this localization in cancer progression is still undetermined. To define the role nuclear AURKA plays in metastatic dissemination and colonization of distant organs, we created TNBC (triple negative breast cancer) cell lines with CRISPR/Cas9 based deletion of endogenous AURKA and rescue with exogenous AURKA specifically targeted to the nucleus, cytoplasm or both. more...

1468. Effect of bone marrow microenvironment on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to antiestrogens
(Submitter supplied) Hormonal therapy (HT) inhibits the growth of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast (BrCa) and prostate (PrCa) cancers. HT resistance frequently develops within the complex metastatic microenvironment of the host-organ (often the bone), a setting poorly recapitulated in two-dimensional (2D) culture systems. To address this limitation, we cultured HR+ BrCa/PrCa spheroids and patient-derived organoids in 3D extracellular matrices (ECM) alone or together with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). more...

(Submitter supplied) Predictive models based on gene expression are already a part of medical decision making for selected situations such as early breast cancer treatment. Most of these models are based on measures that do not capture critical aspects of gene splicing, butwith RNA sequencing it is possible to capture some of these aspects of alternative splicing and use them to improve clinical predictions. Building on previous models to predict cigarette smoking status, we show that measures of alternative splicing significantly improve the accuracy of these predictive models.

1536. MLL3 is a de novo Cause of Endocrine Therapy Resistance
(Submitter supplied) a.Background Cancer resequencing studies have revealed epigenetic enzymes as common targets for recurrent mutations. The monomethyltransferase MLL3 is among the most recurrently mutated enzymes in ER+ breast cancer. The H3K4me1 marks created by MLL3 can define enhancers. In ER+ breast cancer, ERα genome binding sites are primarily distal enhancers. Thus, we hypothesize that mutation of MLL3 will alter the genomic binding and transcriptional regulatory activity of ERα. more...

1547. O-linked mucin-type glycosylation regulates the transcriptional programme downstream of EGFR in breast cancer.
(Submitter supplied) Aberrant mucin type O-linked glycosylation is a common occurrence in cancer. This type of O-linked glycosylation can occur on many cell surface glycoproteins where only a small number of sites may be present. EGFR is one such glycoprotein. Upon EGF ligation, EGFR induces a signaling cascade but can also translocate to the nucleus where it can directly regulate gene transcription. Here we show that upon EGF binding, breast cancer cells carrying different O-linked glycans respond by transcribing differential gene expression signatures. more...

1568. Combination of iron deprivation and chemotherapies treatments in breast cancer xenografts
(Submitter supplied) To ensure their high proliferation rate, tumor cells display an iron metabolic disorder with increased iron needs, making them more susceptible to iron deprivation. This vulnerability could be a therapeutic target. In breast cancers, the development of new therapeutic approaches is urgently needed for patients with triple negative tumors which frequently relapse after chemotherapy and suffer from a lack of targeted therapies. more...

Existing methods for deciding whether PMDs exist in a sample, as well as their identification, are few, often tailored to specific biological questions, and require high coverage samples for accurate identification. In this study, we outline a set of axioms that take a step towards a functional definition for PMDs, describe an improved method for comparable PMD detection across samples with substantially different sequencing depths, and refine the decision criteria for whether a sample contains PMDs using a data-driven approach. more...

(Submitter supplied) Accumulating evidence has shown that cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) induce antiviral innate immune responses in human normal and malignant cancer cells. However, it is not fully understood how endogenous ‘self’ dsRNA homeostasis is regulated in the cell. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, DEAD-box RNA helicase 3X (DDX3X), prevents the aberrant accumulation of cellular dsRNAs. Loss of DDX3X induces dsRNA sensor-mediated type I interferon signaling and innate immune response in breast cancer cells due to abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female malignancies worldwide, and 70% of cases are estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive. In this study, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM8 acts as a novel regulator of ER signaling. TRIM8 is downregulated in BC and is associated with poor prognosis. In addition, the protein level of TRIM8 is negatively correlated with ERα expression. To investigate whether TRIM8 mediated estrogen signaling pathway, we generated a knockdown model of TRIM8 in human MCF7 cells.

(Submitter supplied) The EGFR/Ras/ERK signalling pathway is a primary driver of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in tumours that exhibit high cell-to-cell heterogeneity. While the signalling activity of this pathway is frequently amplified in tumours, it is not understood how the kinetic aspects of its activation in tumours differ from normal cellular signalling. We explored these single-cell kinetic differences using live-cell reporters of ERK signalling in the breast cancer progression series HMT-3522 and found that ERK activity in invasive cells is similar in amplitude to non-malignant cells but is highly dynamic and more disordered, leading to more heterogeneous expression of ERK target genes. more...

1692. Functional determinants of sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition or cell-cycle plasticity
(Submitter supplied) Intrinsic or acquired resistance to clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as a major obstacle that hinders their utility beyond ER+ breast cancer.   Palbociclib-sensitive ER+ breast cancer models and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models were employed to identify functional determinants of response.   In all models tested the activation of RB and inhibition of CDK2 activity emerged as determinants of sensitivity.   While depleting CDK4 and 6 was sufficient to limit proliferation in specific resistance setting, RB loss renders cells completely CDK4/6 independent.   The main down-stream target in this context is the activation status of CDK2 which is suppressed with CDK4/6 inhibition in an RB-dependent fashion.  The P27KIP1 protein levels are associated with plasticity/rigidity of the cell cycle and correlates with sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibiion.   Exogenous overexpression and pharmacological induction of P27KIP1 by targeting the MEK/ERK pathway enhances the cytostatic effect of palbociclib. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Hypoxia is pervasive in cancer and other diseases. Cells sense and adapt to hypoxia by activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), but it is still an outstanding question why cell types differ in their transcriptional response to hypoxia.   Results: Here, we report that HIFs fail to bind CpG dinucleotides that are methylated in their consensus binding sequence, both in in vitro biochemical binding assays and in vivo studies of differentially methylated isogenic cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) We have previously shown that RING1B, a core Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 subunit, is amplified in 22% of breast cancer patients. In ER+ breast cancer, RING1B functionally interacts and co-localizes with ERa at enhancers and actively transcibed genes to modulate oncogenic transcriptional programs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in ER+ breast cancer cells, prolonged estrogen (E2) administration induces fluctuations in transcriptional output and chromatin landscape. more...

1741. Memory sequencing reveals heritable single cell gene expression programs associated with distinct cellular behaviors
(Submitter supplied) Non-genetic factors can cause individual cells to fluctuate substantially in gene expression levels over time. Yet it remains unclear whether these fluctuations can persist for much longer than the time of one cell division. Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the duration of gene expression fluctuations or cellular memory difficult to measure. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we treated a nove ER-positive PDX (UCD12) supplemented with estrogen (E2) with or without thyroid hormone (TH) and/or tamoxifen (Tam). Each treatment cohort (E2 alone, E2 + TH, E2 + Tam, E2+ TH+Tam) tumor growth over time was monitored. Tumors treated with TH continued to grow more that E2 alone. Tamoxifen blocked E2-mediated tumor growth, however in the presence of TH this was not seen. This analysis identified thyroid hormone as a potential driver of tumor progression in the context of estrogen receptor positive PDX tumor model.

Here, we developed a systematic toolbox for profiling fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples using scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq, respectively. more...

(Submitter supplied) Plasticity of neoplasia, whereby cancer cells attain stem-cell-like properties, is required for disease progression and represents a major therapeutic challenge. Hypoxia induces breast cancer cell plasticity and stem-cell-like phenotypes. Although this process is poorly understood, reports demonstrate that hypoxia induces the expression of stemness-factors including NANOG, SNAIL and NODAL. Moreover, both stem-cell-like phenotypes and elevated expression of stemness-factors have been linked to metastatic spread and chemoresistance. more...

1808. Whole transcriptome profiling of ESR1 Q375H and R394H mutatons from the human breast cancer MB-231 stable cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogeh insensitivity syndrome (EIS) arises from rare mutations in estrogen receptor α (ERα, encoded by ESR1 gene) resulting in the inability of estrogen to exert its biological effects. Due to the rarity, mutations in ESR1 gene and the underlying molecular mechanisms of EIS have not been thoroughly studied. We used whole transcriptome analysis to comparison of the transcriptome between the WT ESR1 and Q375H and R394H clinical mutants in MB231 stable cell lines.

1810. Targeting the mevalonate pathway to overcome acquired anti-HER2 treatment resistance in breast cancer [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Despite effective strategies, therapy resistance in HER2+ breast cancer remains a challenge. While the Mevalonate pathway (MVA) is suggested to promote cell growth and survival, including in HER2+ models, its potential role in resistance to HER2-targeted therapy is unknown. Using HER2+ breast cancer parental (P) cell models (AU565, SKBR3, and UACC812), we have established anti-HER2-resistant derivatives made resistant to lapatinib (LR) or lapatinib plus trastuzumab (LTR). more...

1811. RNA-seq of ERINA knockdown T47D cell lines
(Submitter supplied) We identified an intergenic lncRNA ERINA (estrogen inducible lncRNA) as a novel lncRNA that is associated with chemo-resistance and highly expressed in multiple cancer types, especially in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers. Functional characterizations based on RNA-seq analyses established ERINA as an oncogenic lncRNA, because knockdown of ERINA in breast cancer cells inhibits cell cycle progression and tumor cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo.

1843. Impact of aromatase inhibitor treatment on global gene expression and its association with antiproliferative response in ER+ breast cancer in postmenopausal patients
(Submitter supplied) Endocrine therapy reduces breast cancer mortality by 40%; but resistance remains a major clinical problem. Identification of gene signatures associated with resistance during endocrine treatment should enable rational therapeutic choices to be made to combat this in individual patients. Here we present an in-depth analysis of global gene-expression that was measured on pairs of core-cut biopsies taken at baseline and at surgery from 254 patients with ER-positive primary breast cancer randomised to receive 2-week’s presurgical AI (n=198) or no presurgical treatment (Control n=56) in the POETIC trial, using changes-in and residual-of the proliferation marker, Ki67 as end-points, to investigate the impact of aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy on gene expression and identify gene modules representing key biological pathways that relate to early AI-therapy resistance. more...

1845. Transcriptional diversity and bioenergetic shift in human breast cancer metastasis revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Although metastasis remains the cause of most cancer-related mortality, mechanisms governing seeding in distal tissues are poorly understood. Here we establish a robust method for identification of global transcriptomic changes in rare metastatic cells during seeding using single-cell RNA-sequencing and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer. We find that both primary tumours and micrometastases display transcriptional heterogeneity, but micrometastases harbor a distinct transcriptome program conserved across PDX models that is highly predictive of poor survival in patients. more...

1854. Neurofibromin is an Estrogen Receptor alpha Transcriptional Co-repressor in Breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) We report that neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and Ras-GAP (GTPase Activating Protein), is also an estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) transcriptional co-repressor through leucine/isoleucine-rich motifs that are functionally independent of GAP activity.  GAP activity, in turn, does not impact ER binding. Consequently, neurofibromin-depletion causes estradiol hypersensitivity and tamoxifen agonism, explaining the poor prognosis associated with neurofibromin-loss in endocrine therapy-treated ER+ breast cancer. more...

1875. Comparison of MPA regulated gene expression profiles to those regulated by PROG, DHT, DEX
(Submitter supplied) Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a progestin that can bind to and activate progesterone, androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. However, it is not known which receptor mediates MPA action in a cellular context where all three of these receptors are co-expressed and functional. This microarray experiment was performed to compare the transcriptomes induced by MPA and the cognate ligands for these receptors ie progesterone (PROG), 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and dexamethasone (DEX) in breast cancer cells to determine which was most similar to MPA.

1876. miR-146 connects stem cell identity with metabolism and pharmacological resistance in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Although ectopic overexpression of miRNAs can influence mammary normal and cancer stem cells (SCs/CSCs), their physiological relevance remains uncertain. Here, we found that the miR-146 family is linked to SC identity, since: i) their expression is very high in SCs/CSCs from human/mouse primary mammary tissues; correlates with the basal-like breast cancer subtype, which typically has a high CSC content; and specifically distinguishes cells with SC/CSC identity; ii) miR-146 depletion reduces SC/CSC self-renewal in vitro and the number of tumor-initiating cells in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) The DNA-binding protein CTCF and the cohesin complex function together to shape chromatin architecture in mammalian cells, but the molecular details of this process remain unclear. We demonstrate that a 79 amino acid region within the CTCF N-terminal domain but not the C-terminus is necessary for cohesin positioning at CTCF binding sites and chromatin loop formation. However, the N-terminus of CTCF, when fused to artificial zinc fingers that do not bind to CTCF DNA binding sites was not sufficient to redirect cohesin to different genomic locations, indicating that cohesin positioning by CTCF does not involve direct protein-protein interactions with cohesin subunits. more...

(Submitter supplied) Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer factor that facilitates chromatin binding and function of lineage-specific and oncogenic transcription factors. Here, we have demonstrated that FOXA1 overexpression in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells drives genome-wide enhancer reprogramming to activate pro-metastatic transcriptional programs. We have identified the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-2α as the top FOXA1-engaged super-enhancer target induced by FOXA1 overexpression, activating pro-metastatic gene signatures associated with poor breast cancer outcome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumor metastasis is the most lethal attribute of breast cancer, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in this process. Alternative splicing has been shown to causally contribute to EMT; however, the scope of critical splicing events and the regulatory network of splicing factors that govern them remain largely unexplored. Here we report the identification of A-Kinase Anchor Protein (AKAP8) as an EMT splicing regulatory factor that impedes EMT and breast cancer metastasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) β-caryophyllene (BCP) exhibits anti-proliferative properties in cancer cells.  Here, we examine the hypothesis that BCP induces membrane remodeling.  Our data show that high concentrations of BCP increase membrane permeability of human breast cells (hBrC) causing detachment and cell death.  At a “sub-lethal” concentration of BCP, we show that BCP induces a striking upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, including the gene that encodes for HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-determining step in cholesterol biosynthesis. more...

However the known fragility of RNA and artifacts introduced through the processes of tissue preservation and storage introduce the possibility of unfaithful RNA expression signatures from these sources. more...

1944. Co-Culture of CD8+ T cells and Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) Targeting of tumor immune escape mechanisms holds enormous therapeutic potential. Still, most patients progress under immune checkpoint blockade and some even become hyper-progressors. To investigate how cancer cells respond to activated but ineffective T cells, we challenged peptide-loaded MCF-7 breast cancer cells with antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in which Perforin had been destroyed by pre-treatment with Concanamycin A.

1946. STING-dependent paracriny shapes apoptotic priming of breast tumors in response to anti-mitotic treatment
(Submitter supplied) A fascinating but uncharacterized action of antimitotic chemotherapy is to collectively prime cancer cells to apoptotic mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), while impacting only on cycling cell subsets. Here, we show that a proapoptotic secretory phenotype is induced by activation of cGAS/STING in cancer cells that are hit by antimitotic treatment, accumulate micronuclei and maintain mitochondrial integrity despite intrinsic apoptotic pressure. more...

However, the majority of mammary tumors from genetically engineered mouse models are ERα-negative. To model ERα-positive breast cancer in mice, we exogenously introduced expression of mouse and human ERα in an existing p53-deficiency driven breast cancer mouse model. After initial ERα expression during development of the mammary gland, expression was reduced or lost in adult glands and p53-deficient mammary tumors. more...

(Submitter supplied) In the present study, Linc00673 displayed high expression in breast cancer tissues and was associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Importantly, Linc00673 depletion inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation by impairing cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Mechanically, RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the potential crosstalk between Linc00673 and its targets. We found that Linc00673 acted as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-515-5p to regulate MARK4 expression which inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway to promote proliferation of breast cancer.

2015. The EN1 transcription factor drives neural features and brain metastases in triple negative breats cancer (TNBC)
(Submitter supplied) To define transcriptional dependencies of TNBCs, we identified transcription factors highly and specifically expressed in primary TNBCs and tested their requirement for cell growth in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We found that EN1 is overexpressed in TNBCs and its downregulation preferentially and significantly reduces cellular viability and tumorigenicity in TNBC cell lines. Based on RNA-seq and ChIPseq we found that EN1 regulates genes involved in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and axon guidance in breast cancer cells. more...

2018. Chronic cadmium exposure decreases the dependency of MCF7 breast cancer cells on ERα
(Submitter supplied) To understand how chronic cadmium exposure alters the dependency of ERα in terms of gene expression, we transiently silenced ERα using ICI, an antiestrogen that promotes the degradation of ERα. MCF7 and cadmium-adapted cells (Cd7 and Cd12) were treated with ICI to mediate the degradation of ERα, and a nonbiased global gene expression analysis was conducted using RNA-seq.  MCF7 shared 67.3% and 59.5% of the DE genes with Cd7 and Cd12 cells, respectively, suggesting that ERα continues to play an important role in regulating the expression of genes following chronic cadmium exposure. more...

2021. LSD1 maintains mammary luminal cell differentiation and suppresses luminal breast cancer cell invasion
(Submitter supplied) LSD1 (KDM1A) is a histone demethylase that plays both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in breast cancer. However, the exact contexts under which it plays these opposite roles remain largely elusive. By characterizing its role in normal and cancerous luminal mammary epithelial cells (MECs), here we show that LSD1 is essential for maintaining differentiation and survival of luminal cells. LSD1-inhibition by both genetic and pharmacological approaches increases invasion of luminal breast cancer cells. more...

2024. Tumor Heterogeneity in Metastatic Potential is Indicated by Adhesion Strength
(Submitter supplied) Tumors are heterogeneous and comprised of cells with varying function and ability to disseminate. Despite significant effort, no universal biological marker currently serves as a metric for metastatic potential of solid tumors. Common to disseminating cells from such tumors, however, is the need to modulate their adhesion as they detach from the tumor and migrate through stroma to intravasate. Adhesion strength is heterogeneous even amongst cancer cells within a given population, and using a parallel plate flow chamber, we separated and sorted these populations into weakly and strongly adherent groups; when cultured under stromal conditions, this adhesion phenotype is stable over multiple days, sorting cycles, and common across all epithelial tumor lines investigated. more...

2050. Promoter activity profiling reveals on- and off-target transcriptional responses to drug treatment
(Submitter supplied) Owing to safety concerns or insufficient potential for efficacy, only 0.01% to 0.02% of new drug candidates are approved for marketing. Drugs already on the market may be withdrawn or restricted to certain uses due to adverse effects (AEs) discovered after market introduction. Comprehensively investigating the on-/off-target effects of drugs can help expose AEs during the drug development process. In this study, we developed an integrative framework for systematic identification of on-/off-target pathways and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms, by combining expression profiling after drug treatment with gene perturbation of the primary drug target. more...

2051. C/EBPa mediates the growth inhibitory effect of progestins on breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Steroid hormones are key gene regulators in breast cancer cells. While estrogens stimulate cell proliferation, progestins activate a single cell cycle followed by proliferation arrest. Here, we use biochemical and genome wide approaches to show that progestins achieve this effect via a functional crosstalk with C/EBPα. Using ChIP-seq, we identify around 1,000 sites where C/EBPα binding precedes and helps binding of Progesterone Receptor (PR) in response to hormone. more...

(Submitter supplied) The β-catenin mutation is frequently observed in hepatoblastoma (HB), but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces HB tumor formation is unknown. We found that expression of growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) depends on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HB patients. GREB1 was localized to the nucleus where it bound Smad2/3 in a competitive manner with p300 and inhibited TGFβ signaling, thereby promoting HepG2 HB cell proliferation. more...

However, clonal selection is incompatible with the late recurrence often characterising luminal breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy (ET), suggesting a more complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors. In the present study, we dissect the contributions of clonal genetic diversity and transcriptional plasticity during the early and late phases of ET at single-cell resolution. more...

However, whether tumor-associated stroma induces epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in tumor cell clusters, to promote invasion and metastasis, remains unknown. We demonstrate herein that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) frequently present in tumor stroma drive the formation of tumor cell clusters composed of two distinct cancer cell populations, one in a highly-epithelial (E-cadherin-high ZEB1-low/neg: E-hi) state and another in a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E-cadherin-low ZEB1-high: E/M) state. more...

(Submitter supplied) Overcoming cellular growth restriction, including the evasion of cellular senescence, is a hallmark of cancer. We report that PAK4 is overexpressed in all human breast cancer subtypes and associated with poor patient outcome. In mice, MMTV-PAK4 overexpression promotes spontaneous mammary cancer, while PAK4 gene depletion delays MMTV-PyMT driven tumors. Importantly, PAK4 prevents senescence-like growth arrest in breast cancer cells in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo, but is not needed in non-immortalized cells, while PAK4 overexpression in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells abrogates H-Ras-V12-induced senescence. more...

2084. ProMyelocytic Leukemia protein IV (PMLIV) represses breast cancer proliferation by modulating the FOXO3-FOXM1 axis
(Submitter supplied) The multitasking ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein, which was originally recognized as tumor suppressive factor, is commonly lost in primary breast cancer tissue samples. However, PML’s role in breast cancer is still debated, as high PML levels reportedly correlate with cancer cell pro-survival activity and poor patient prognosis in a subset of breast cancer types. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of PML in cell proliferation and self-renewal pathways in breast cancer, a transgene expressing PMLIV upon doxycycline treatment was stably integrated in MDA-MB-231 cells (tetPMLIV MDA-MB-231 cells), a claudin-low, triple negative, aggressive breast cancer cell line. more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is the most common cancer that threatens women's health. While the strategy of drug combination can help to reduce adverse effects and to overcome the resistance of clinical treatment of single drug. In this work, we report the synergetic effect between a HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG and a HDAC inhibitor Belinostat, on the triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The RNA-Seq data analysis showed that the most over-represented KEGG pathways in the combination group came from migration or invasion related genes, which were not observed in the differentially expressed genes after the treatment of 17-AAG or Belinostat alone.

2116. Estrogen receptor and mTOR signaling rewires cancer metabolism in obesity-associated breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal ERα (+) breast cancer. Molecular mechanisms activated by the factors from serum that contribute to this risk and how these mechanisms affect ERα signaling are yet to be elucidated. To identify such mechanisms, we performed whole metabolite and protein profiling in serum samples, which enabled us to focus on factors that were differentially present in serum from cancer-free vs. more...

2117. MCF-7 as a model for functional analysis of breast cancer risk variants
(Submitter supplied) Here we report how the ER+ cell line MCF-7 can be used to inform risk mechanisms for BCa. We identified active regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters, and chromatin organizing elements) by histone H3K27 acetylation and CTCF occupancy and determined the enrichment of risk variants at these sites. We measured gene expression via RNA-seq. After intersection with GWAS risk variants we found 39 enhancers and 15 CTCF occupancy sites that, between them, overlapped 96 BCa credible risk variants at 42 loci. more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a disease with diverse phenotypes, and while the progression of breast cancer from a localized lesion to metastatic disease is well understood clinically. Our previous study genetically linked the FRY gene with differential susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis; however, little is known about the mechanistic insights of FRY in mammalian cells and breast cancer progression. Through RNA-Seq analysis of series of constructed cell lines based on highly malignant triple-negative human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, we show that enhanced FRY induces massive changes in gene expression, which favor signalings and molecules with tumor-suppressive functions and engage in promoting cell differentiation, maintaining the normal and histopathological characteristics of epithelial cells, and in regulating EMT potential of breast cancer cells. more...

Using ChIP-seq, we show that PTEN co-localizes with RNAPII and binds to chromatin in promoter and putative enhancer regions. We further show that loss of PTEN affects RNAPII occupancy in gene bodies and correlates with gene expression changes. Loss of PTEN also increased cells’ sensitivity to transcription inhibition via small molecules.

2162. Acquisition of a hybrid E/M state is essential for tumorigenicity of basal breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Using the recently described CD104+/CD44hi antigen combination we demonstrate that tumorigenicity depends on individual cells residing in a hybrid E/M state. Acquisition of this E/M hybrid state is facilitated by the differential expression of EMT- TFs, like Snail accompanied by the expression of adult stem-cell programs. Transition from the highly tumorigenic E/M state to a fully mesenchymal phenotype, achieved by constitutive ectopic expression of Zeb1, is sufficient to drive cells out of the E/M hybrid state into an extreme mesenchymal (xM) state, which is accompanied by a substantial loss of tumorigenicity and a switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signaling.

2169. Comparison of Mature Megakaryocytes Differentiated by TPO or Small Molecule TPO Mimetics
(Submitter supplied) TPO mimetics have been shown to activate TPO receptor, the downstream JAK-STAT pathway, and induce differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into megakaryocytes.  However, the action of these TPO mimetics is initiated by binding to the transmembrane domain of the TPO receptor, which is distinct from the binding site of the native ligand, TPO.  To determine whether TPO mimetics can differentiate hematopoietic stem cells into the same megakaryocytes as native TPO does, we performed a microarray experiment to compare the globe gene expression in purified CD61+ cells derived from TPO or TPO mimetic treated CD34+ bone marrow cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling gene, underlie small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). To reveal its druggable vulnerabilities, we perform kinase-focused RNAi screens and uncover that SMARCA4-deficient SCCOHT cells are highly sensitive to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). SMARCA4 loss causes profound downregulation of cyclin D1, which limits CDK4/6 kinase activity in SCCOHT cells and leads to in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibitors. more...

2220. Antagonism of IAPs enhances CAR T cell efficacy
(Submitter supplied) Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has proven highly successful in the treatment of hematological malignancies, notably acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B cell lymphoma. However, the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors is poor, likely due to tumor-associated immunosuppression. Here, we demonstrate that antagonizing Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) with the clinical smac-mimetic, birinapant, significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells in a TNF-dependent manner. more...

(Submitter supplied) The ability of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to form clusters has been linked to increased metastatic potential. Yet biological features and vulnerabilities of CTC clusters remain largely unknown. Our DNA methylation analysis led us to hypothesize that CTC clusters are characterized by active TF networks that support both stemness and proliferation. To identify whether the stemness- and proliferation-related TF networks are also transcriptionally active in CTC clusters compared to single CTCs, we performed single-cell resolution RNA sequencing analysis of single CTCs and CTC clusters, matched within individual liquid biopsies and isolated from six breast cancer patients with progressive metastatic disease, and of single CTCs and CTC clusters isolated from three xenograft models. more...

2288. Estradiol-regulated Dependence Receptor UNC5A Restricts Estradiol Signaling and Luminal to Basal Transition and Metastasis of Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancers, while initially being responsive, eventually develop resistance to ERα targeted therapies through ERα-dependent and ERα-independent mechanisms.  Through functional genomic studies we report heretofore unrecognized role for the axon guidance dependence receptor UNC5A in fine-tuning estradiol (E2) and anti-estrogen response.  Knockdown of the estradiol-inducible UNC5A caused unrestricted ERα signaling as evident from deregulated E2-regulated gene expression and E2-independent tumorigenesis accompanied with multi-organ metastatic spread in xenograft models. more...

2323. MYC interacts with the G9a histone methyltransferase to drive transcriptional repression and tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) MYC is an oncogenic driver that regulates transcriptional activation and repression, yet molecular mechanisms of MYC transformation remain unclear. We demonstrate that MYC interacts with the G9a H3K9-methyltransferase complex to control transcriptional repression. Inhibiting G9a hinders MYC chromatin binding at MYC-repressed genes and de-represses gene expression to antagonize cellular transformation. more...

2324. Development and Characterisation of Acquired Radioresistant Breast Cancer Cell Lines.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Radiotherapy plays an important role in the multimodal treatment of breast cancer. The response of a breast tumour to radiation depends not only on its innate radiosensitivity but also on tumour repopulation by cells that have developed radioresistance. Development of effective cancer treatments will require further molecular dissection of the processes that contribute to resistance.  Methods: Radioresistant cell lines were established by exposing MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and ZR-751 parental cells to increasing weekly doses of radiation. more...

2325. TET2 coactivates gene expression through demethylation of enhancers
(Submitter supplied) The tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the modified DNA base 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. TET2 is frequently mutated or dysregulated in multiple human cancers, and loss of TET2 is associated with changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here, using newly developed TET2-specific antibodies and the estrogen response as a model system for studying the regulation of gene expression, we demonstrate that endogenous TET2 occupies active enhancers and facilitates the proper recruitment of ERalpha. more...

2373. Polycomb complexes associate with enhancers to promote oncogenic transcriptional programs in cancer
(Submitter supplied) The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 play an essential role in cell fate decisions, embryonic development and gene regulation. While the functions of PRC2 in cancer are under intense study, the function of PRC1 in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that RNF2, the gene encoding RING1B, and canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) genes are amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Specifically, in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer cells, cPRC1 is functionally associated with enhancers and genes regulated by ERa, while in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, a different cPRC1 variant is recruited to enhancers and promoters occupied by the bromodomain protein BRD4. more...

2396. MDA-MB-231 gene expression upon IRE1 RNase inhibition with MKC-8866
(Submitter supplied) The IRE1 Rnase domain has been implicated in the pathology of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease with limited treatment options. The IRE1 Rnase mediates it's effects on the transcriptome via activation of the trancription factor XBP1s and via direct cleavage of mRNA through a process called RIDD. The processes through which the RNase domain contributes to TNBC is not fully understood. We used a novel small molecule inhibitor of the IRE1 Rnase to find novel targets of IRE1 in TNBC, in an effort to elucidate how it contributes to the disease.

(Submitter supplied) Activation induced cell death (AICD) of T lymphocytes may be exploited by cancers to eliminate cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Here, we demonstrated excessive apoptosis of tumor antigen-specific CTLs in breast and lung cancers. Interestingly, NKILA, an NF-κB interacting lncRNA, sensitizes CTLs to AICD by inhibiting NF-κB activities after their activation. In vivo, administering CTLs with NKILA silencing into immunocompromised mice with breast cancer patient derived xenografts (PDXs) effectively inhibits PDX growth by increasing CTL infiltration. more...

2436. LSD1 ablation stimulates anti-tumor immunity and enables checkpoint blockade
(Submitter supplied) Chromatin regulators play a broad role in regulating gene expression, and when gone awry, can lead to cancer. Here we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs, and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to dsRNA stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. more...

2464. BRG1 governs Glucocorticoid Receptor interactions with chromatin and pioneer factors across the genome
(Submitter supplied) The Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) alters transcriptional activity in response to hormones by interacting with chromatin at GR binding sites (GBSs) throughout the genome. Our work in human breast cancer cells identifies three classes of GBSs with distinct epigenetic characteristics and reveals that BRG1 interacts with GBSs prior to hormone exposure. The GBSs pre-occupied by BRG1 are more accessible and transcriptionally active than other GBSs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is an understudied malignancy with distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular features that distinguish it from the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Mounting evidence suggests that estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER+) ILC has a poor response to Tamoxifen (TAM), but the mechanistic drivers of this are undefined. In the current work, we comprehensively characterize the SUM44/LCCTam ILC model system through integrated analysis of gene expression, copy number, and mutation, with the goal of identifying actionable alterations relevant to clinical ILC that can be co-targeted along with ER to improve treatment outcomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) First, we want to know whether JMY117 (Bupropion) would act as a blockade to attenuate nicotine induced cancer metastatic effect. With two months observations, we discovered that nicotine treatment (10 µg/ml) via drinking water significantly increased tumor distant metastasis. Furthermore, using 100 and 200 µg/kg JMY117 three times per week significantly suppressed the numbers of lung metastasis nodules on both with or without nicotine treatment, indicating JMY117 not only block the signals from nicotine but also inhibits the signals from other endogenous nAChR agonists. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single - cell profiling of patient tumours and of mouse models is revealing that many cancers are constituted of communities of genetically and phenotypically distinct clonal lineages 1 - 12. A functional model of breast cancer heterogeneity revealed that clonal sub - populations proficient at generating circulating tumour cells were not equally capable of forming metastases at secondary sites 13. A combination of differential expression and focused in vitro and in vivo RNAi screens revealed candidate drivers of metastasis discriminating these clones, which were then evaluated in gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients. more...

Selective degradation of gain-of-function p53 mutants has emerged as a highly attractive therapeutic strategy to target cancer cells harboring specific p53 mutations. We identified a small molecule called MCB-613 to cause rapid ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation of p53-R175H through lysosome-mediated pathway leading to catastrophic cancer cell death. more...

In this study we used an unbiased genome-wide expression array to investigate Smac mimetic BV6-induced gene regulation in breast cancer cell lines. Kinetic analysis revealed that BV6 alters gene expression in two waves. The first wave primarily involves NF-κB- and AP-1 families of transcription factors, while the second wave largely depends on tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling. more...

2547. SUMOylation Regulates Transcription by the Progesterone Receptor A Isoform in a Target Gene Selective Manner
(Submitter supplied) Luminal breast cancers express estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and respond to endocrine therapies. However, some ER+PR+ tumors display intrinsic or acquired resistance, possibly related to PR. Two PR isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, regulate distinct gene subsets that may differentially influence tumor fate. A high PR-A:PR-B ratio is associated with poor prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. We speculate that excessive PR-A marks tumors that will relapse early. more...

2569. A cytoplasmic COMPASS is necessary for cell survival and triple-negative breast cancer pathogenesis by regulating metabolism
(Submitter supplied) Mutations and translocations within the COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) family of histone lysine methyltransferases are associated with a large number of human diseases, including cancer. Here we report that SET1B/COMPASS, which is essential for cell survival, surprisingly has a cytoplasmic variant. SET1B, but not its SET domain, is critical for maintaining cell viability, indicating a novel catalytic-independent role of SET1B/COMPASS. more...

2574. Targeting the vulnerability of RB tumor suppressor loss in triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Approximately 30% of TNBCs exhibit loss of function of the RB tumor suppressor. The study used RNA sequencing to profile RB-proficient and RB-deficient TNBC cases that were defined based on immunostaining for RB and p16ink4a.   The analyses revealed that RB-deficient TNBC cases express elevated levels of DNA replication and mitotic genes that could serve as the basis for increased sensitivity to drugs targeting cell cycle checkpoints.

Cytoskeletal regulators are dually required in mesenchymal cells by promoting EMT-induced migration and sustaining the EMT program itself. In search for novel regulators of metastasis, we conducted an shRNA screen targeting a class of microtubule regulators, the plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs). We show that the +TIP ACF7 is required for both the maintenance of EMT and to promote migration. more...

(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Breast radiotherapy is currently “one size fits all” regardless of breast cancer subtype (eg. luminal, basal). However, recent clinical data suggests that radiation response may vary significantly among subtypes.  Therefore, current practice leads to over- or under-treatment of women whose tumors are more or less radiation responsive.  We hypothesized that this clinical variability may be due, in part, to differences in cellular radiation response. more...

(Submitter supplied) Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) represent at least 1/5 of the mammalian transcript amount, and about 90% of the genome length is actively transcribed. Many ncRNAs have been demonstrated to play a role in cancer. Among them, natural antisense transcripts (NAT) are RNA sequences which are complementary and overlapping to those of protein-coding transcripts (PCT). NATs were punctually described as regulating gene expression, and are expected to act more frequently in cis than other ncRNAs that commonly function in trans. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is an important step during breast tumorgenesis. Understanding its molecular changes may uncover both novel preventive and therapeutic strategies and may help to identify high-risk DCIS that progress to IDC. The mechanisms are unknown and the role of CapG in the nucleus is an enigma. Here, we tested the association between clinicopathological CapG expression in tumor samples and used a cell culture model to test the hypothesis that CapG affects gene expression. more...

2614. Gene expression changes associated with high density collagen microenviroment in cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) We report RNA sequencing data from 2 cancer cell line (fibrosarcoma, HT1080 and Breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) and one non-canceours cell line (human foreskin fibroblast HFF) embbeded in two different 3D collagen matrix environements. The topographical organization of collagen within the tumor ECM has been implicated in guiding cancer cell migration and independently predicts progression to metastasis. Here, we show that collagen matrices with small pores and short fibers, but not Matrigel, trigger a conserved transcriptional response and subsequent motility switch in cancer cells that results in formation of multicellular network structures. The response is not mediated by hypoxia, matrix stiffness, or bulk matrix density, but by matrix architecture and beta1 integrin upregulation. The transcriptional module associated with network formation is enriched for migration and vasculogenesis-associated genes that predicted survival in patient data across nine distinct tumor types. Evidence at the protein level of this gene module is found in patient tumors displaying a vasculogenic mimicry (VM) phenotype. Our findings link a collagen matrix-induced migration program to VM, and suggest that this process may be broadly relevant to metastatic progression in solid human cancers.

2643. Analysis of the miR-34 family functions in breast cancer reveals annotation error of miR-34b
(Submitter supplied) The miR-34 family of microRNAs consisting of miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c are tumour suppressors. The annotated human miR-34b-5p has one additional base at the 5’ end of the common miR-34 family seed sequence, compared to miR-34a-5p and miR-34c-5p. This extra base results in a shift of the seed sequence, which would affect the target gene repertoire and have functional consequences. During our studies of miR-34 functions, we investigated the precise sequence of mature miR-34b-5p in human cells by deep sequencing. more...

2698. Mitochondrial DNA drives tumor dormancy escape in ER+ breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Although the estrogen receptor (ER) positive variant of breast cancer is touted as the most indolent and favorable, the majority of breast cancer deaths are in fact from this subtype. There are several features of this category of breast cancers that likely account for this outcome. The first is that metastatic relapse can occur many years after initial diagnosis of primary disease. The second is that once the cancer cells awaken into full-blown metastatic disease, they are largely resistant to ER-directed therapies (i.e. more...

(Submitter supplied) Lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ that has structural organization related to their immune function, which is highly ordered and compartmentalized. Lymph nodes shelter immune cells and also fibroblastic-like cells such as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). FRCs have mesodermal origin and are classically characterized by the expression of podoplanin (PDPN/gp38) and lack of CD31 expression. FRCs are implicated in several immune processes but the pathways subjacent their function are still a matter of research. more...

2718. ATM signalling and autophagy cooperate in the regulation of breast cancer stem-like phenotype: a transcriptional profile
(Submitter supplied) In the last past decades, it has been focused the attention on a new emerging concept in the field of cancer research, such as the involvement of a small fraction of cells within many solid tumours that seem to be responsible for tumour initiation, maintenance and, more importantly, for drug resistance, called cancer stem cells (CSCs). According to this hypothesis, this pool of cells could be distinguished from all the other tumour cells, not only because they have different properties, such as the ability to self-renew or to differentiate into different tumour types, but also because they grow in a specific microenvironment, suggesting a different metabolic requirement; understanding this concept and the signalling pathways involved could be be extremely important for the development of new specific therapeutic drugs. more...

2731. Analysis of the transcriptional response to retinoic acid in T47D breast cancer cells with impaired RARA function
(Submitter supplied) It has been shown that retinoic acid (RA) can both inhibit and promote cancer cell growth, but the basis of this “paradox” is still not clear. The action of RA is mainly mediated by RA receptors (RARs), which classically function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Upon binding to the RA receptor alpha (RARA), RA modulates the transcription of several RA-target genes involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation. more...

2791. Role of HER2 in breast cancer stem cells
(Submitter supplied) HER2 overexpression results in expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We performed microarray analysis to obtain HER2-induced gene expression profiles in MCF10A breast epithelial cells and found that an array of inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL-1 and IL-6, are activated.  Our study indicates that targeting the HER2-IL-1α-IL-6 axis provides an effective approach for eliminating of CSCs and treating HER2-positive breast cancer.

2793. CD95/Fas increases stemness in cancer cells by inducing a STAT1 dependent Type I interferon response [array]
(Submitter supplied) CD95 was found to be important for both the formation of CSCs and their maintenance.  Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis  we have now identified STAT1 as a critical gene that mediates the CSC-driving activity of CD95.  We report that chronic stimulation of CD95 by either agonist antibodies, soluble CD95L or stably  expressed membrane CD95L causes both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and activation  of STAT1 regulated genes. more...

2794. Robust Stratification of Breast Cancer Subtypes
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death of women worldwide, is a heterogenous disease with multiple different subtypes. These subtypes carry important implications for prognosis and therapy. Interestingly, it is known that these different subtypes not only have different biological behaviors, but also have distinct gene expression profiles. However, it has not been rigorously explored whether particular transcriptional isoforms are also differentially expressed among breast cancer subtypes, or whether transcript isoforms from the same sets of genes can be used to differentiate subtypes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Hormone therapy targeting estrogen receptor (ER) is the principal treatment for ER-positive breast cancers but many cancers develop resistance to anti-estrogens. Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a transcriptional regulator of several oncogenic pathways. Expression levels of CDK8 and ERα are inversely correlated in breast cancers suggesting a functional association between CDK8 and ER. CDK8 inhibition by selective small-molecule inhibitors, by shRNA knockdown or by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout suppressed estrogen-induced transcription, with no significant effects on ERα protein expression or phosphorylation. more...

2825. Microarray of MCF10A cells with/without LATS1/2, expressing YAP/TAZ or ESR1 cDNA
(Submitter supplied) Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer. However, the regulation of breast cell fate remains largely elusive. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium but the molecular mechanisms underlying breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. more...

Phenotypic changes were more severe in high FACT cells (death or growth arrest) than in low FACT cells (decreased proliferation). Though inhibition had no effect on the rate of general transcription, expression of individual genes was changed in a cell-specific manner. Initially distinct transcriptional profiles of BrCa cells became almost identical via equalizing FACT expression. more...

2883. The footprint of the aging stroma in older breast cancer patients.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Tumoral masses are not only composed of malignant cells, but also enclose a more or less ample stromal micromilieu, which has been shown to influence the cancer cell behaviour. As aging induces accumulation of senescent cells in the body, this micromilieu is thought to be different in cancers occurring in old patients compared to the younger counterparts. More specifically, senescence-related fibroblastic features, such as the Senescence Associated Secretory Profile (SASP) and the induction of Autophagy, are suspected to stimulate tumor growth and progression. more...

2907. Estrogen receptor α promotes breast cancer by reprogramming cell metabolism [gene expression]
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a key regulator of breast growth and breast cancer development. However, the role of ERα in metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer, is not well documented. In this study, using an integrated approach combining genome-wide mapping of chromatin bound ERα with estrogen induced transcript and metabolic profiling, we demonstrate that ERα reprograms metabolism upon estrogen stimulation, including changes in aerobic glycolysis, nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, and choline metabolism. more...

2912. Intermittent hypoxia confers pro-metastatic gene expression selectively through NF-kB in inflammatory breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer. Treatment options are limited and the mechanisms underlying its aggressiveness are poorly understood. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) causes oxidative stress and is emerging as important regulator of tumor metastasis. Vessels in IBC tumors were shown to be immature, which is a primary cause of IH. We therefore investigated the relevance of IH for the modulation of gene expression in IBC cells in order to assess IH as potential regulator of IBC aggressiveness. more...

(Submitter supplied) Abstract BACKGROUND: The basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) subtype is characterized by positive staining for basal mammary epithelial cytokeratin markers, lack of hormone receptor and HER2 expression, and poor prognosis with currently no approved molecularly-targeted therapies. The oncogenic signaling pathways driving basal-like tumorigenesis are not fully elucidated.  METHODS: One hundred sixteen unselected breast tumors were subjected to integrated analysis of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway related molecular aberrations by immunohistochemistry, mutation analysis, and gene expression profiling. more...

2938. An integrative transcriptomics approach identifies miR-503 as a candidate master regulator of the estrogen response [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is an important biomarker of breast cancer severity and a common therapeutic target. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its role in promoting proliferation, ERα also protects tumors against metastatic transformation. Current therapeutics antagonize ERα and interfere with both beneficial and detrimental signaling pathways stimulated by ERα. The goal of this study is to uncover the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNA (microRNA) expression in response to estrogen stimulation and identify potential therapeutic targets that more specifically inhibit ERα-stimulated growth and survival pathways without interfering with its protective features. more...

2940. The effect of IKKβ on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer phenotypes
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ER) is a good prognostic marker expressed in ~75% of breast tumors. Women with ER+ tumors will receive endocrine therapy, yet ~50% will experience relapse and late recurrence ~5-20 years after primary diagnosis. The recurrent tumors are often aggressive, resistant, and metastatic. A growing body of evidence suggests that an inflammatory microenvironment and the activation of the NF-ĸB pathway are highly associated with the progression of ER+ tumors to more aggressive stages. more...

2949. The Chromatin-Looping Factor ZNF143 Engages at Looping Promoters to Favor the Estrogen Response in Breast Cancer (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells relies on long-range chromatin interactions connecting distal regulatory elements bound by the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) to target gene promoters. This ensures stimulus and subtype-specific transcriptional responses. Expanding on the function of CTCF and the cohesin complex in breast cancer, we demonstrate that the chromatin-looping factor ZNF143 binds the promoter of most early-response estrogen target genes connected to distal regulatory elements in ESR1-positive breast cancer cells. more...

Emerging evidence implicates a key role for nonmutational mechanisms including changes in cell state during early stages of acquired drug resistance. Targeting nonmutational resistance may therefore present a therapeutic opportunity to eliminate residual surviving tumor cells and impede relapse. A variety of cancer cell lines harbor quiescent, reversibly drug-tolerant “persister” cells which survive cytotoxic drugs including targeted therapies and chemotherapies. more...

Here, we report the development of structurally novel estrogens with favorable target tissue-selective estrogenic activity. Through a process of structural alteration of the hormone estradiol that preserves essential chemical and physical features of estradiol but greatly moderates its binding affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs), we obtained Pathway Preferential Estrogens (PaPEs) capable of having interaction with ER that is sufficient to activate the extranuclear-initiated signaling pathway preferentially over the direct nuclear-initiated pathway. more...

2974. Molecular features of subtype-specific progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer [gene expression data]
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer consists of at least five main molecular “intrinsic” subtypes, which are reflected in both pre-invasive and invasive disease. Although previous studies have suggested that many of the molecular features of invasive breast cancer are established early, it is unclear what mechanisms drive progression, and whether the mechanisms of progression are dependent or independent of subtype.

2976. Ridaforolimus (MK-8669) synergizes with Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in hormone-sensitive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) represents a key downstream intermediate for a myriad of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option.   Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; “MK-0646”; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; “MK-8669”; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (“LET”, aromatase inhibitor).   Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach.   Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors.

2990. NAD+ Analog-sensitive PARPs Reveal a Role for PARP-1 in Transcription Elongation
(Submitter supplied) The PARP family of proteins comprises 17 members, about two thirds of which are active mono- or poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase enzymes that transfer the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ onto target proteins.  In many cases, ADP-ribosylation, which plays critical roles in human diseases (e.g., cancer, heart disease, and neuropathies) is associated with abrogation of the molecular functions of the target.  Discerning ADP-ribosylation events mediated by a specific PARP is challenging, since all PARPs use the same substrate (i.e., NAD+) and the available inhibitors lack the specificity needed to make such conclusions. more...

3022. FoxA supports breast cancer growth by regulating LIPG transcription and lipid metabolism
(Submitter supplied) The mechanisms that allow breast cancer cells to metabolically sustain growth are poorly understood. In breast cancer, FoxA1 transcription factor, along with estrogen receptor, regulates luminal cell specification and proliferation. Here we report that FoxA transcription factor family members FoxA1 and FoxA2 fuel cellular growth in breast cancer through the expression of a common target gene, namely the endothelial lipase (LIPG) We used microarrays to detail the genes that are under de control of FoxA transcription factors in MDA231 and MCF7 breast cancer cells

3047. Effect of obesity on molecular characteristics of invasive breast tumors: gene expression analysis of 405 tumors by BMI
(Submitter supplied) Background: Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women and is associated with decreased survival and less favorable clinical characteristics such as greater tumor burden, higher grade, and poor prognosis, regardless of menopausal status. Despite the negative impact of obesity on clinical outcome, molecular mechanisms through which excess adiposity influences breast cancer etiology are not well-defined. more...

3048. MCT1 modulates cancer cell pyruvate export and growth of tumors that co-express MCT1 and MCT4
(Submitter supplied) Many cancers rely on glycolytic metabolism to fuel rapid proliferation.  This has spurred interest in designing drugs that target tumor glycolysis such as AZD3965, a small molecule inhibitor of Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) currently undergoing Phase I evaluation for cancer treatment.  Since MCT1 mediates proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane (Halestrap and Meredith, 2004), AZD3965 is thought to block tumor growth through disruption of lactate transport and glycolysis. more...

3049. Tumor Cell-Derived Periostin Regulates Cytokines That Maintain Breast Cancer Stem Cells
(Submitter supplied) Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells share phenotypic similarities with cancer stem cells (CSCs) but the underlying molecular basis for this connection remains elusive. We hypothesized that BLBC cells are able to establish a niche permissive to the maintenance of CSCs and found that tumor cell-derived periostin (POSTN), a component of the extracellular matrix, as well as a corresponding cognate receptor, integrin αvβ3, are highly expressed in a subset of BLBC cell lines as well as in cancer stem cell-enriched populations. more...

3063. HER2 and EGFR dependent activation of RalA in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Activated HER2 and EGFR stimulate the Ras small GTPases, which in turn primarily activate the MAPK, PI3K-Akt and RalGEF-Ral pathways.  While activation of the MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways downstream of HER2 and EGFR promote mammary tumorigenesis, little is known regarding the role of the RalGEF-Ral pathway.  RalGEFs convert the small GTPases RalA and RalB to an active GTP-bound state.  Of the two proteins, only activated RalA is transforming, while RalB is more important for cell motility, and hence we investigated the role of RalA in HER2-overexpressing and EGFR-positive breast cancer. more...

However, good proportion of patients who display lymph node positivity remain disease free for 3 years or more, after the initial treatment, while a third of those who were lymph node negative at presentation, develop distant metastasis within the same period. We performed gene expression profiling on a cohort Indian breast cancer patients  followed up for a period of 3-5 years and in comparison with a previously published Caucasian cohort data, we identified gene signatures that are associated with distant metastasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming of cellular metabolism plays a central role in fuelling malignant transformation, and AMPK as well as the PGC-1α/ERRα axis are key regulators of this process. Intersection of gene expression and binding event datasets in breast cancer cells shows that activation of AMPK significantly increases the expression of PGC-1α/ERRα and promotes the binding of ERRα to its cognate sites. Unexpectedly, the data also reveal that ERRα, in concert with PGC-1α, negatively regulates the expression of several one-carbon metabolism genes resulting in substantial perturbations in purine biosynthesis. more...

3085. Differential expression of genes after alterations in cellular levels of hsa-miR-195
(Submitter supplied) The experiment was designed to identify the genes which get altered after over-expression and depletion of hsa-miR-195 levels in MCF7 and HEK 293T cells. Recent research has established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of many cell processes including those often deregulated in cancer such as apoptosis. In our previous work we have shown that hsa-miR-195 targets the key anti-apoptotic molecule BCL2 and its over-expression induces apoptosis and augments sensitivity of cancer cells towards chemotherapeutic drug. more...

3086. A Luminal, Steroid Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Stem Cell that Generates Intratumoral Heterogeneity is Preserved by Progesterone and Depleted by Estradiol
(Submitter supplied) Most breast cancers are luminal, depending on estrogens for growth. The remainder lack estrogen receptors, are hormone-resistant and basal-like. It is thought that breast cancers arise from self-renewing normal stem cells that have undergone malignant transformation. However currently reported cancer stem cells are hormone insensitive and generate basal, rather than luminal tumors. We now describe true luminal hormone-responsive breast cancer stem cells that express estrogen and progesterone receptors. more...

(Submitter supplied) Aberrant cell proliferation, a hallmark of most cancers, requires the escape from intrinsic antitumour barriers. Primary among these is the DNA damage response (DDR). In both cell culture-models and in early stages of tumorigenesis in vivo, activated oncogenes induce DNA replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), leading to DDR activation and p53-dependent apoptosis and/or senescence. The means by which tumour-initiating cells, also termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), circumvent this oncosuppressive response is unknown. more...

3121. Identification of a mitochondrial defect gene signature reveals NUPR1 as a key regulator of liver cancer progression
(Submitter supplied) Many cancer cells require more glycolytic adenosine triphosphate production due to a mitochondrial respiratory defect. However, the roles of mitochondrial defects in cancer development and progression remain unclear. To address the role of transcriptomic regulation by mitochondrial defects in liver cancer cells, we performed gene expression profiling for three different cell models of mitochondrial defects: cells with chemical respiratory inhibition (rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, antimycin A, and oligomycin), cells with mitochondrial DNA depletion (Rho0), and liver cancer cells harboring mitochondrial defects (SNU354 and SNU423). more...

3122. Small molecule-induced bioenergetic reprogramming directs prostate cancer inhibition via UPR signaling
(Submitter supplied) We previously identified SMIP004 (N-(4-butyl-2-methyl-phenyl) acetamide), as a novel inducer of cancer-cell selective apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells. SMIP004 decreased the levels of positive cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin A, CDK4 and SKP2 while upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21, resulting in G1 arrest and inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. However, the mechanism of SMIP004-induced cancer cell selective apoptosis remained unknown. more...

3123. The effects of CEP-37440, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase, in vitro and in vivo on inflammatory breast cancer cells.
(Submitter supplied) CEP-37440 at low concentration (1,000 nM) decreased the proliferation of the human inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cell line FC-IBC02, while not affecting the proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells. CEP-37440 decreased the cell proliferation of FC-IBC02 by blocking the auto-phosphorylation kinase activity of FAK (Tyr 397). This cell line did not expressed ALK. In vivo, CEP-37440 significantly decreased FC-IBC02 breast tumor xenografts growth with maximum of 40% tumor growth inhibition. more...

3124. Preference of mitochondrial respiration over the Warbürg effect in breast tumor initiating cells in conditions of oxygen and glucose deprivation.
(Submitter supplied) Background: cancer cells rely on glycolysis as main ATP source (Warbürg effect). Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are the fraction of cells that give raise and repopulate tumors. TICs are exposed to prolonged periods of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), as they live in a hypoxic niche and they withstand prolonged lack of blood vessels during initial tumorigenesis or metastasis formation (avascular phase). more...

3125. Downregulation of LATS kinases alters p53 to promote cell migration
(Submitter supplied) p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-?B subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53’s conformation and transcriptional output towards a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants, and endow p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. more...

3146. microRNA miR-142-3p induced expression changes in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs, micro ribonucleic acids) are pivotal post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. These endogenous small non-coding RNAs play significant roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. miR-142-3p expression is dysregulated in several breast cancer subtypes. We aimed at investigating the role of miR-142-3p in breast cancer cell invasiveness. Supported by transcriptomic Affymetrix array analysis and confirmatory investigations at the mRNA and protein level, we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-142-3p in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells leads to downregulation of WASL (Wiskott-Aldrichsyndrome-like, protein: N-WASP), Integrin-aV, RAC1, and CFL2, molecules implicated in cytoskeletal regulation and cell motility. more...

3164. Gene expression profiling in response to radiation treatment in human breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Treatment-related morbidities have been linked to the large post-operative treatment volumes required for external beam partial breast irradiation (PBI).  Alternative PBI techniques require equipment that is not readily available.  To address these issues, we designed a phase I trial utilizing widely available technology to 1) evaluate the safety of a single radiation treatment delivered preoperatively to the small-volume, intact breast tumor and 2) identify imaging and genomic markers of radiation response.

3165. Gene expression profiling in response to radiation treatment in breast cancer [cell lines]
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Breast radiotherapy is currently “one size fits all” regardless of breast cancer subtype (eg. luminal, basal). However, recent clinical data suggests that radiation response may vary significantly among subtypes.  Therefore, current practice leads to over- or under-treatment of women whose tumors are more or less radiation responsive.  We hypothesized that this clinical variability may be due, in part, to differences in cellular radiation response. more...

3200. CDK7-dependent Transcriptional Addiction in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (Microarray)
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer that exhibits extremely high levels of genetic complexity and yet a relatively uniform transcriptional program. We postulate that TNBC might be highly dependent on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of transcription. more...

(Submitter supplied) Glucocorticoids (GC) have been widely used as coadjuvants in the treatment of solid tumors, but GC treatment may be associated with poor pharmacotherapeutic response and/or prognosis. The genomic action of GC in these tumors is largely unknown. Here we find that dexamethasone (Dex, a synthetic GC) regulated genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are associated with drug resistance. Importantly, these GC-regulated genes are aberrantly expressed in TNBC patients and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. more...

3207. RNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells treated for 24h with SAHA, Pargyline, or both [HG-U133A_2]
(Submitter supplied) Abnormal activities of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and lysine deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with aberrant gene expression in breast cancer development. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between KDMs and HDACs in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription are still elusive. In this study, we showed that treatment of human breast cancer cells with inhibitors targeting the zinc cofactor dependent class I/II HDACs, but not NAD+ dependent class III HDACs, led to significant increase of H3K4me2 which is a specific substrate of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and a key chromatin mark promoting transcriptional activation. more...

3210. YB-1 affects response to paclitaxel in TNBCs by modulation of EGR1
(Submitter supplied) For patients with triple negative breast tumours (TNBCs), lacking receptors for oestrogen, progesterone or HER2 on their cell surface, chemotherapy is the main treatment.  The taxanes, paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel, have become the most commonly-used chemotherapies for these kinds of breast cancer.  Although several targeted therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials for TNBC, because of the heterogeneous nature of TNBCs, it is predicted that these may often be used in combination with chemotherapy. more...

We hypothesised that myricetin-derived flavonoids with redox properties and improved physicochemical attributes that enhance cell uptake and mitochondrial targeting might have increased potential as antitumour agents, since mitochondria are the main site of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox status is known to regulate the development and advancement of certain cancers. more...

3212. Estrogen Receptor Beta Impacts Hormone-Induced Alternative mRNA Splicing in Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogens play an important role in breast cancer (BC) development and progression, where the two isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) are generally co-expressed and mediate the effects of these hormones in cancer cells. ERβ has been suggested to exert an antagonist role toward the oncogenic activities of ERα, and for this reason it is considered an oncosuppressor. As clinical evidence regarding a prognostic role for this receptor subtype in hormone-responsive BC is still limited and conflicting, more knowledge is required on the biological functions of ERβ in cancer cells. more...

Here, we identify Pol II associated Factor 1 (PAF1) as a major regulator of promoter-proximal pausing. Knockdown of PAF1 leads to increased release of paused Pol II into gene bodies at thousands of genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Aromatase inhibitors are first-line postmenopausal agents for estrogen receptor alpha (ERa)-positive breast cancer. However, there is considerable response heterogeneity and women frequently relapse. Estrogen deprivation does not completely arrest ERa activity, and transactivation of the unliganded receptor may continue through cross-talk with growth factor pathways. In contrast with aromatase inhibitors, the selective ER downregulator fulvestrant also abrogates ligand-independent ERa activity. more...

3235. LIN28A modulates splicing and gene expression programs in breast cancer cells [RIP-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The goals of this study were to identify LIN28 downstream gene targets in breast cancer cells. We use a subclone of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, MCF-7M as our model system. Methods: mRNA-protein complexes (mRNP) lysates were prepared from MCF-7M cells and incubated with Protein-A Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and either LIN28 (Abcam) or control normal rabbit serum IgG antibodies. LIN28 interacting mRNAs were identified by whole genome sequencing. more...

3236. A Molecular Portrait Of High-Grade Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) DCIS is a non-invasive precursor lesion to invasive breast carcinoma. We still have no understanding on why only some DCIS lesions evolve to invasive cancer while others appear not to do so during the life span of the patient. Here, we performed full exome (tumor vs. matching normal), transcriptome and methylome analysis of 30 pure high-grade DCIS (HG-DCIS) and 10 normal breast epithelial samples. Sixty two percent of HG-DCIS cases displayed mutations affecting cancer driver genes or potential drivers. more...

3237. Comparative analyses of CTCF and BORIS occupancies uncover two distinct classes of CTCF binding genomic regions
(Submitter supplied) CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

(Submitter supplied) An emerging theme of gene regulation is the involvement of architectural chromosomal molecules in transcription control. Condensins are critical regulators of mitotic chromosomes, but their interphase chromatin localization and functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that both the condensin I and condensin II complexes exhibit an unexpected, dramatic 17-?-estradiol-induced preferential recruitment to oestrogen receptor ? (ER-?)-bound active enhancers in interphase breast cancer cells, exhibiting non-canonical interaction with ER-? distinct from classic cofactors. more...

3240. Dynamics of gene expression changes in epithelial and mesenchymal HMLER cell lines transitioning from suspension 3D culture to adhesion cultures
(Submitter supplied) In order to metastasize, few cells need to detach from the primary tumor, and transition through the circulation to distant sites to establish new solid tumor metastases. The gene expression changes occurring between these transitions are poorly understood, and controversial findings have been reported regarding transitions between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) cell states. To model the metastasis process in vitro, here we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes and respective cell fates that are occurring in cells that are transitioning from adhesion culture to suspension 3D culture (mammospheres) and back to adhesion culture in vitro. more...

3254. Mutational activation of a mechanosensitive megachannel drives metastatic cell survival.
(Submitter supplied) Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized cancer biology by accelerating the unbiased discovery of novel mutations across human cancers. Transforming such discoveries into a conceptual framework of cancer progression requires narrowing the vast number of mutations down to the driver elements, and further reducing these to mutations that govern cancer progression as opposed to tumor initiation. By integrating next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) with in vivo selection, we devise an approach that identifies a series of novel recurrent non-synonymous amino acid mutations that are enriched in metastatic breast cancer cells and predicted to significantly alter protein function. more...

3273. Selective inhibition of SIN3 corepressor with avermectins as a novel therapeutic strategy in triple negative breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) lacking estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors account for 10-20% of breast cancer and are indicative of poor prognosis. The development of effective treatment strategies therefore represents a pressing unmet clinical need. We previously identified a molecularly-targeted approach to target aberrant epigenetics of TNBC using a peptide corresponding to the SIN3 interaction domain (SID) of MAD. more...

3276. Expression data from mutant p53 breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3
(Submitter supplied) Tumor associated mutant p53 proteins often gain new functions for tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  It has been shown that mutant p53 can transcriptionally regulate a group of genes, which in turn contributes to mutant p53 gain of function.  A mutant p53 interacting protein Pontin binds to mutant p53 and promotes its gain of function.  This experiment tests whether the interaction of Pontin with mutant p53 regulates the transcriptional activity of mutant p53. more...

3278. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), the TNF-like receptor TWEAKR and its ligand TWEAK act downstream of NFAT1 to regulate breast cancer cell invasion
(Submitter supplied) NFAT1 is a transcription factor that elicits breast carcinoma cells to become invasive, contributing thus to formation of metastases. The molecular mechanisms by which NFAT1 operates in this respect are still poorly known. Here, we report that NFAT1 increases Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) mRNA and protein expression by binding to specific sites in the LCN2 gene promoter region. We show that the LCN2 protein is required downstream of NFAT1 to increase breast cancer cell invasion. more...

3311. PI3K inhibition results in enhanced estrogen receptor function and dependence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Activating mutations of PIK3CA are the most frequent genomic alterations in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors and selective PI3Kα inhibitors are in clinical development. The activity of these agents, however, is not homogenous and only a fraction of patients bearing PIK3CA-mutant ER-positive tumors benefit from single agent administration. Searching for mechanisms of resistance, we observed that suppression of PI3K signaling with different agents results in induction of ER-dependent transcriptional activity as demonstrated by changes in expression in genes containing ER binding sites, enhanced ER transcription and increased occupancy by the ER of promoter regions of upregulated genes. more...

3315. Gene expression study of MCF7/tet-off clones expressing different HER2 isoforms
(Submitter supplied) HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor causally involved in cancer. A subgroup of breast cancer patients with particularly poor clinical outcome expresses a heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs). However, since the CTFs lack the extracellular domain that drives dimerization and subsequent activation of full-length HER2, they are in principle expected to be inactive. Here we present evidence that at low expression levels one of these fragments, 611-CTF, activated multiple signaling pathways because of its unanticipated ability to constitutively homodimerize. more...

Ovarian cancer risk can be decreased by risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Studies on RRSO material have altered the paradigm of serous ovarian cancer pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to identify candidate genes possibly involved in pathogenesis of serous ovarian cancer by carrying out a microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes in BRCA1/2- mutation positive ovarian and fallopian tube epithelium derived from RRSO surgery. more...

3349. Effect of cajanin stilbene acid and its synthetic derivatives on MCF-7 breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Cajanin stilbene acid (CSA) was previously shown to induce cytotoxicity against cancer cells. We have employed microarray gene expression profiling to identify deregulated genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells upon treatment with CSA and its synthetic derivatives (CSA6, CSA9, CSA19). TGM2 gene encoding transglutaminase 2 was commonly deregulated after treatment with all four CSA compounds. All compounds revealed strong effects on cell cycle progression and DNA damage response. more...

3350. Gene expression profiling of patient's DCIS-IDC tandem lesions by RNA sequencing analysis
(Submitter supplied) Tandem DCIS/IDC are defined as ductal carcicnoma in situ (DCIS) lesions that have concurrent invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) within the same breast. These are identified radiologically by an area of clustered microcalcifications adjacent to (contiguous with) an invasive mass. Our radiologist (Dr. William P. Smith) has provided us with biopsy cores from each region. One core from each region (DCIS and IDC) has bas been collected and subjected to RNA sequencing for our studies to compare changes from DCIS to IDC in each individual patient.

3351. TWIST1-induced microRNA-424 drives an intermediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that opposes metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that relies on cellular plasticity; an EMT/MET axis is critical for metastatic colonization of carcinomas. Unlike epithelial programming, regulation of mesenchymal programming is not well understood in EMT. Here we describe the first microRNA that enhances exclusively mesenchymal programming. We demonstrate that microRNA-424 is up-regulated early during a TWIST1/SNAI1-induced EMT, and that it causes cells to express mesenchymal genes without affecting epithelial genes, resulting in a mixed/intermediate EMT. more...

(Submitter supplied) Disappearance of the Barr body has long been considered a hallmark of cancer, although whether this corresponds to epigenetic instability and transcriptional reactivation, or to genetic loss, has remained unclear. Here we show that in breast cancer cell lines as well as primary breast tumors, the inactive X chromosome frequently displays a highly abnormal 3D nuclear organization, with global perturbations in its characteristic heterochromatic state, including apparent gain of euchromatic marks and lessening of repressive marks such as H3K27me3 and promoter DNA methylation. more...

(Submitter supplied) A variety of mechanotransduction forces are altered in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and these biophysical forces can influence cancer progression. One such force is interstitial fluid flow (IFF) - the movement of fluid through the tissue matrix. IFF was previously shown to induce invasion of cancer cells, but the activated signaling cascades remain poorly understood. Here, it is demonstrated that IFF induces invasion of ERBB2/HER2 expressing breast cancer cells via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). more...

3384. Calcitriol Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) Effects of calcitriol on expressions of ER stress related genes were evaluated with microarray. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and increase intracellular calcium. Increase in cytopalsmic calcicium levels may indicate a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels since ER is the main storage unit for calcium. Decrease in ER calcium levels are known to induce ER stress which can lead to apoptosis. more...

3387. Global analysis of TGF-beta-regulated gene expression in MCF10Ca1h (M3) breast tumor xenografts
(Submitter supplied) TGF-betas have complex roles in tumorigenesis,  with context-dependent effects that can either suppress or promote tumor progression. We have previously shown that TGF-beta has tumor suppressor activity in the MCF10Ca1h (M3) human breast cancer xenograft model.  To identify potential molecular players in the tumor suppressor responses,  we performed global gene expression analyses. To determine which genes were regulated by TGF-beta in this tumor model in vivo,  we performed gene expression arrays on tumors derived from xenografts of M3 cells with and without expression of a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor to block activity of endogenous TGF-beta.

3428. HOXB7 is an ERα cofactor in the activation of HER2 and multiple ER target genes leading to endocrine resistance
(Submitter supplied) Why breast cancers become resistant to tamoxifen despite continued expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and what factors are responsible for high HER2 expression in these tumors remains an enigma. HOXB7 ChIP analysis followed by validation showed that HOXB7 physically interacts with ERα, and that the HOXB7-ERα complex enhances transcription of many ERα target genes including HER2. Investigating strategies for controlling HOXB7, our studies revealed that MYC, stabilized via phosphorylation mediated by EGFR-HER2 signaling, inhibits transcription of miRNA-196a, a HOXB7 repressor. more...

3432. BCL11A is a triple-negative breast cancer gene with critical functions in stem and progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognostic outcome compared to other types  of breast cancer1. At present the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TNBC  pathology are not well understood1. Here we report that the transcription factor BCL11A is  overexpressed in TNBC including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and that its genomic locus  is amplified in up to 38% of BLBC tumours. BCL11A overexpression in immortalised human  breast epithelial cells promotes tumour formation in xenograft models, whereas knockdown  of BCL11A in TNBC cell lines suppresses their tumourigenic potential. In the DMBA-induced  mouse mammary tumour model, Bcl11a is found to be essential for tumourigenesis since  deletion of Bcl11a before DMBA treatment substantially decreases tumour formation, even in  p53-null cells, and inactivation of Bcl11a in established tumours causes their regression. At  the cellular level, BCL11A overexpression enhances clonogenicity in vitro whereas its deletion  in the mouse causes a reduction in the number of mammary epithelial stem and progenitor  cells. Thus, BCL11A has an important role in the genesis of TNBC and in normal mammary  epithelial cells. This study highlights the importance of further investigation of BCL11A in  breast cancer diagnosis and targeted therapies.

Here we show that RBBP6 (retinoblastoma-binding protein 6), identified initially as an Rb- and p53-binding protein, is a component of this complex and functions in 3' processing in vitro and in vivo. RBBP6 associates with other core factors, and this interaction is mediated by an unusual ubiquitin-like domain, DWNN (domain with no name), that is required for 3' processing activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) In the normal breast, PMCA2 transports calcium into milk. It is also  upregulated in breast cancer cells and high tumor levels predict increased  mortality in patients. In this study, we examined interactions between PMCA2  and HER2. We find that PMCA2 and a scaffolding protein, NHERF1, interact  together with HER2 in specific membrane domains protruding from the surface of  breast cancer cells. Knocking down PMCA2 or NHERF1 increases intracellular  calcium and leads to the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of HER2  after receptor activation. more...

3457. The prognostic ease and difficulty of invasive breast carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Breast carcinoma (BC) have been extensively profiled by high-throughput technologies for over a decade, and broadly speaking, these studies can be grouped into those that seek to identify patient subtypes (studies of heterogeneity) or those that seek to identify gene signatures with prognostic or predictive capacity. The shear number of reported signatures has led to speculation that everything is prognostic in BC. more...

3458. Genome-wide analysis of the effect of knockdown of the nuclear poly(A) binding proteins, PABPN1 and ZC3H14 on steady-state mRNA levels
(Submitter supplied) The polyadenosine RNA binding proteins (Pabs) represent one class of RNA binding proteins that play critical roles in gene expression. This class includes the well-studied nuclear and cytoplasmic Pabs, PABPN1 and PABPC1, respectively, as well as the newly characterized nuclear Pab, zinc finger CCCH-type containing #14, or ZC3H14. ZC3H14 was recently linked to a form of intellectual disability, suggesting a critical role for ZC3H14 in neurons; however, the post-transcriptional function of ZC3H14 is unknown. more...

3459. Distinct structural transitions of chromatin topological domains coordinate hormone-induced gene regulation
(Submitter supplied) The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome within the cell nucleus contributes to cell-specific gene expression in different cell types1. High-throughput 3C–derived methods have revealed that the genome is segmented into contiguous topologically associating domains (TADs), which help to orchestrate gene expression changes during differentiation and development2-5. Using ChIP-Seq, Hi-C and 3D modelling techniques, we reveal that TADs regulate the rapid gene expression changes induced by progestin in T47D breast cancer cells. more...

3463. Breast cancer cell lines treated with eribulin and paclitaxel
(Submitter supplied) Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic macrocyclic ketone analog of the marine sponge natural product halichondrin B. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, leading to inhibition of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening at microtubule plus ends, and formation of nonproductive tubulin aggregates. In this study, we investigated whether selective signal pathways were associated with eribulin activity compared to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, based on gene expression profiling of cell line panels of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer in vitro.

3465. Expression data from menadione, PERK inhibitor, or control-treated HMLE-shGFP and HMLE-Twist human mammary epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) Malignant carcinomas that recur following therapy are typically de-differentiated and multi-drug resistant (MDR). De-differentiated cancer cells acquire MDR by upregulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes and drug efflux pumps, but how these genes are upregulated in response to de-differentiation is not known. Here, we examine this question by using global transcriptional profiling to identify ROS-induced genes that are already upregulated in de-differentiated cells, even in the absence of oxidative damage. more...

3497. Suppression of the FOXM1 transcriptional program via novel small molecule inhibition
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor FOXM1 binds to sequence-specific motifs on DNA (C/TAAACA) through its DNA binding domain (DBD), and activates proliferation- and differentiation-associated genes. Aberrant overexpression of FOXM1 is a key feature in oncogenesis and progression of many human cancers. Herein we identify novel inhibitors of FOXM1 that block DNA binding from a high-throughput screen applied to a library of 54,211 small molecules. more...

3529. Stromal and epithelial changes in breast cancer following endocrine treatment
(Submitter supplied) Patients diagnosed with breast cancer were recruited to an important trial, the Tamoxifen Window Trial, in two series, series A during 1988-1989 and series B during 1989-1990. Some patients received tamoxifen for short windows. Clinical samples (biopsies) for this trial were collected before and after treatment. These biopsies were available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Responding patients and non-responding patients were determined by the change in the Ki67 scores. Responding patients were identified as those that had demonstrated a reduction in their Ki67 scores, and non-responding patients were identified as those in which Ki67 had not changed or had increased. The change in the percentage of Ki67 positive tumour cells was obtained by comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment scores and calculating the difference in the scores. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was utilised to microdissect the epithelial and stromal cells from the post-treatment breast cancer FFPE tissue sections of responding and non-responding patients. Samples obtained following LCM underwent RNA extraction and were subsequently used for gene expression profiling.

3538. Over-expression of miR-146a in basal-like breast cancer cells confers enhanced tumorigenic potential in association with altered p53 status
(Submitter supplied) The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers, mutated in 25-30% of breast cancers. However, mutation rates differ according to breast cancer subtype, being more prevalent in aggressive estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors, basal-like and HER2 amplified subtypes. This heterogeneity suggests that p53 may function differently across breast cancer subtypes. We used RNAi-mediated p53 knockdown (KD) and antagomir-mediated KD of microRNAs to study how gene expression and cellular response to p53 loss differ in luminal vs. more...

3541. Insights into the invasiveness of triple negative breast cancer from genome-wide profiling of transcription factor AP-1 (expression)
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype, and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor component, Fra-1, is overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, and its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative and invasive phenotypes in TNBC cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in women under 30. Unlike their malignant counterparts, relatively molecular profiling has been done on fibroadenomas. Here we performed gene expression profiling on ten fibroadenomas in order to better characterize these tumors. Through targeted amplicon sequencing, we have found that six of these tumors have MED12 mutations. We show that the MED12 mutations, among others, are associated with activated estrogen signaling, as well as increased invasiveness through upregulation of ECM remodelling genes.

(Submitter supplied) Gene-level and exon-level analysis of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells that stably express control shRNA or integrin α3-targeting shRNA. The laminin-332-binding integrin α3b1 is expressed highly in many breast cancer cells, but its roles in regulating gene expression programs that promote breast cancer progression have not been explored.  In order to identify genes that are regulated by α3b1 in human breast cancer cells, we used a lentiviral approach to express an α3-targeting shRNA to suppress integrin α3b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, and we identified subsequent changes in gene expression and alternate exon useage.

3607. Genome-wide activity of unliganded Estrogen Receptor alpha in breast cancer cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) ERα is essential for the anti-proliferative response of breast cancer cells not only to estrogen antagonists, but also to estrogen withdrawal by means of aromatase inhibitors. We explored here one of the simplest explanation for this, consisting in the possibility that ERα may have a wide genomic function in absence of ligands. The genomic binding of ERα in the complete absence of estrogen was then studied using hormone-dependent MCF7 cells, by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recognition of modified histones by “reader” proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription1. H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions following RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin at an appropriate state to suppress cryptic transcription2,3. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancers with HER2 overexpression are sensitive to drugs targeting the receptor or its kinase activity. HER2-targeting drugs are initially effective against HER2- positive breast cancer, but resistance inevitably occurs. We previously found that nuclear factor kappa B is hyper-activated in the subset of HER-2 positive breast cancer cells and tissue specimens. In this study, we report that constitutively active NF-κB rendered HER2-positive cancer cells resistant to anti-HER2 drugs, and cells selected for Lapatinib resistance up-regulated NF-κB. more...

3632. Expression profiling of migrated and invaded breast cancer cells predicts early metastatic relapse and reveals Krüppel-like factor 9 as a potential suppressor of invasive growth in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Cell motility and invasion initiate metastasis. However, only a subpopulation of cancer cells within a tumor will ultimately become invasive. Due to this stochastic and transient nature, in an experimental setting, migrating and invading cells need to be isolated from the general population in order to study the gene expression profiles linked to these processes. This report describes microarray analysis on RNA derived from migrated or invaded subpopulations of triple negative breast cancer cells in a Transwell set-up, at two different time points during motility and invasion, pre-determined as “early” and “late” in real-time kinetic assessments. more...

3645. RNA-seq differential expression studies: more sequence, or more replication?
(Submitter supplied) Motivation: RNA-seq is replacing microarrays as the primary tool for gene expression studies. Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources. Results: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. more...

3659. Genome-wide analysis of RNAs translationally regulated upon BRCA1 depletion in human mammary epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) Loss of function of the tumor suppressor BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) protein is responsible for numerous familial and sporadic breast cancers. We previously identified PABP1 as a novel BRCA1 partner and showed that BRCA1 modulates translation through its interaction with PABP1. We showed that the global translation was diminished in BRCA1-depleted cells and increased in BRCA1-overexpressing cells. Our findings raised the question whether BRCA1 affects translation of all cytoplasmic cellular mRNAs or whether it specifically targets a subset of mRNAs. more...

3664. Human breast cancer associated fibroblasts exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which prognosis and treatment strategies are largely governed by the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone and Her2-neu) of the tumor cells.  Gene expression profiling of whole breast tumors further stratifies breast cancer into several molecular subtypes which also co-segregate with the receptor status of the tumor cells.  We postulated that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor stroma may exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles and thus contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype specific manner. more...

Using a novel chimeric mammary transgenic approach and in vitro models, we demonstrate markedly increased self renewal and tumour propagating capability of cells transformed with Her2 and c-Myc. Co-expression of both oncogenes in cultured cells led to a pronounced activation of a c-Myc transcriptional signature and acquisition of a self renewing phenotype independent of an EMT programme or regulation of cancer stem cell markers. more...

3732. A Common Docking (CD) Domain in Progesterone Receptor-B Links MKP3-Dependent Rapid Signaling Events to JAK/STAT Regulation of Gene Expression Required for Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Progesterone receptors (PRs) are critical context-dependent transcription factors required for normal uterine (PR-A) and mammary gland (PR-B) development. Progesterone is proliferative in the breast, where PR-target genes include paracrine factors that mediate mammary stem cell self-renewal. In the context of altered signal transduction that typifies breast tumorigenesis, dysregulated (i.e. hyper-phosphorylated) PRs likely contribute to tumor progression by promoting cancer cell pro-survival and proliferation. more...

(Submitter supplied) We have analyzed, using DNA microarrays, putative differences in gene-expression level between hereditary BRCA1 mutation-linked and sporadic breast cancer. Our results show that a previously reported marked difference between BRCA1-mutation linked and sporadic breast cancer was probably due to uneven stratification of samples with different ER status and basal-like versus luminal-like subtype. We observed that apparent difference between BRCA1-linked and other types of breast cancer found in univariate analysis was diminished when data were corrected for ER status and molecular subtype in multivariate analyses. more...

(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a nuclear receptor that is the driving transcription factor expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Recent studies have demonstrated that the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), another nuclear receptor, is ERα-regulated in breast cancer cells. Further, LRH-1 stimulates proliferation and promotes motility and invasion of breast cancer cells. To determine the mechanisms of LRH-1 action in breast cancer cells, we carried out gene expression microarray analysis following siRNA-mediated LRH-1 knockdown. more...

3758. Multiscale Gene Networks Dissect the Complexity of Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Despite the enormous amounts of molecular, cellular, and clinical data that are increasingly available for many different types of cancer, it remains a challenge to integrate different dimensions of data to construct mechanistic models that can robustly distinguish key driver genes from passenger genes, predict tumor progression, and tailor therapies optimally for individual patients. We present an integrative biology approach to constructing and analyzing multiscale regulatory networks of breast cancer. more...

(Submitter supplied) Efforts to improve the clinical outcome of highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have been hindered by the lack of effective targeted therapies. Thus, it is important to identify the specific gene targets/pathways driving the invasive phenotype to develop more effective therapeutics. Here we show that ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing B (UBASH3B), a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is overexpressed in TNBC, where it supports malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis largely through modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). more...

(Submitter supplied) Human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-conditioned medium (CM) was previously reported to affect the biology of tumor cells; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that MSCs secreted 40- to 100-nm particles, which have the typical characteristics of exosomes, and these MSC-derived exosomes promoted migration of the breast cancer cell line MCF7. To further investigate the effect of MSC-exosomes on MCF7, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of MCF7 treated with or without MSC-exosomes for 24 h.

3806. Cohesin is required for expression of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) gene
(Submitter supplied) In this study we show that depletion of the cohesin subunit SMC3 or the Mediator subunit MED12 significantly impairs the ERα-regulated transcriptome. Surprisingly, SMC3 depletion appears to elicit this effect indirectly by rapidly decreasing ESR1 transcription and ERα protein levels. Moreover, we provide evidence that both SMC3 and MED12 colocalize on the ESR1 gene and are mutually required for occupancy as well as for transcriptional elongation. more...

3834. Transcriptomic survey of lymph node-positive vs. - negative ductal breast cancer
(Submitter supplied)   Lymph node involvement is a major prognostic variable in breast cancer. Whether the molecular mechanisms that drive breast cancer cells to colonize lymph nodes are shared with their capacity to form distant metastases is yet to be established. In a transcriptomic survey aimed at identifying molecular factors associated with lymph node involvement of ductal breast cancer, we found that luminal differentiation, assessed by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) and GATA3, was only infrequently lost in node-positive primary tumors and in matched lymph node metastases. more...

3835. Mechanotransduction regulates adipose estrogen output and its impact on tumor cell growth
(Submitter supplied) Adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are the primary source of local estrogens in adipose tissue, aberrant production of which promotes estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.  Here we show that extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity and cell contractility are two opposing determinants for estrogen output of ASCs.  Using synthetic ECMs and elastomeric micropost arrays with tunable rigidity, we find that increasing matrix compliance induces transcription of aromatase, a rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis. more...

3838. Gene expression profiles of MCF7 breast cancer cells following estrogen and anti-estrogen treatment.
(Submitter supplied) We have previously demonstrated that endoxifen is the most important tamoxifen metabolite responsible for eliciting the anti-estrogenic effects of this drug in breast cancer cells expressing estrogen receptor-alpha. The goals of this study were to compare the gene expression profiles elicited by endoxifen to that of other anti-estrogens in MCF7 cells.  We also examined the gene expression profiles elicited by various endoxifen concentrations in the presence of tamoxifen and its other primary metabolites in order to better understand the molecular contributions of endoxifen to the effects of tamoxifen.

(Submitter supplied) The forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle and is overexpressed in cancer. Increased levels of FOXM1 are associated with both poor prognosis and oestrogen receptor (ERalpha) status in primary breast cancer. In this study, we map FOXM1 binding genome wide in both ERalpha-positive (MCF-7) and -negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. We identify a common set of FOXM1 binding events at cell cycle-regulating genes, but in addition, in MCF-7 cells we find a high level of concordance with ERalpha-binding regions. more...

However, at low inoculation cell numbers down to 10^3 cells only S2N sphere cells generated xenograft tumors. mRNA profiling revealed a unique cluster pattern of the tumorigenic S2N sphere cells, but a detailed analysis of TIC relevant transcription factors like Oct3, Sox and Nanog family members, Myc, Slug or Twist1 revealed no consistently  increased  expression in the highly tumorigenic cell lines. more...

3871. CXCR4 activation maintains a stem cell population in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells through AHR signaling
(Submitter supplied) Targeting the estrogen signaling pathway has proved to be of great value in the treatment of human breast cancer. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is the most widely used antiestrogen. However, only 40-50% of patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer benefit from tamoxifen treatment and 30-50% acquire resistance and the disease progresses. Continuous treatment with conventional therapy may contribute to cancer progression in recurring cancers through the accumulation of drug resistant cancer progenitors. more...

3872. Gene expression profiling of breast carcinomas using leftovers from diagnostic Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology
(Submitter supplied) INTRODUCTION. Gene expression profiling has emerged as a potentially useful tool for personalized management of breast cancer. Adequate RNA can be obtained for this scope from dedicated fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), with the limitation that separate sampling prohibits direct comparison with the material used for cytology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether syringe leftovers of cytological smears obtained in diagnostic FNACs can be successfully used to extract RNA for reliable PCR- and microarray-based gene expression analysis. more...

3880. Nucleosome driven transcription factor binding and gene regulation [microarray]
(Submitter supplied) Elucidating the global function of a transcription factor implies the identification of its target genes and genomic binding sites. The role of chromatin in this context is unclear, but the dominant view is that factors bind preferentially to nucleosome-depleted regions, identified as DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHS). Here we show by chromatin-IP, MNase and DNaseI assays followed by deep sequencing that the progesterone receptor (PR) requires nucleosomes for optimal binding and function. more...

(Submitter supplied) The cellular response to DNA damage is mediated through multiple pathways that regulate and coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest  and cell death. We show that the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) is coordinated in breast cancer  cells by selective mRNA translation mediated by high levels of translation initiation factor eIF4G1. Increased expression of eIF4G1,  common in breast cancers, was found to selectively increase translation of mRNAs involved in cell survival and the DDR, preventing  autophagy and apoptosis (Survivin, HIF1α, XIAP), promoting cell cycle arrest (GADD45a, p53, ATRIP, Chk1) and DNA repair (53BP1,  BRCA1/2, PARP, Rfc2-5, ATM, MRE-11, others). more...

3908. TFPI alpha and beta regulate mRNAs involved in cancer biology and in the immune system
(Submitter supplied) Emerging evidences indicate a new role of TFPI in cancer biology. We recently reported that both isoforms of TFPI induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of cancer cells. The signaling pathway(s) mediating the effects of TFPI is, however, presently still unclear. Our goal was to further investigate the cellular processes affected by TFPI and to get insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of TFPI, using a global gene expression study approach. more...

3927. The effect of ACSL4 expression on overall gene expression in breast cancer cell lines
(Submitter supplied) ACSL4 expression appears to be inversely associated with steroid hormone and growth factor receptor expression in breast cancer and positively correlated with an aggressive breast cancer phenotype.  Neither MCF-7 nor SKBr3 cells normally express ACSL4, and when manipulated to do so, develop basal-like characteristics, including increased proliferation, migration and anchorage independent growth.  We used an Affymetrix array platform to assess changes in individual gene expression as a function of conditional and stable expression of ACSL4 in MCF-7 and SKBr3 cells.

Our analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy by p53 using ChIP-seq (deposited in Sequence Read Archive database as SRP007261) revealed “p53 default program”, i.e. the pattern of major p53-bound sites that is similar upon p53 activation by nutlin3a, RITA or 5-FU in breast cancer cells, despite different biological outcomes triggered by these compounds. more...

3940. Network Biology of Tumor Stem-like Cells Identified a Regulatory Role of CBX5 in Lung Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Mounting evidence points to a link between a cancer possessing stem-like properties and a worse prognosis. To understand the biology, a common approach is to integrate network biology with signal processing mechanics. That said, even with the right tools, predicting the risk for a highly susceptible target using only a handful of gene signatures remains very difficult. By compiling the expression profiles of a panel of tumor stem-like cells (TSLCs) originating in different tissues, comparing these to their parental tumor cells (PTCs) and the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and integrating network analysis with signaling mechanics, we propose that network topologically-weighted signaling processing measurements under tissue-specific conditions can provide scalable and predicable target identification. more...

(Submitter supplied) Metastatic relapse of breast cancer and other tumor types usually occurs several years after surgical resection of the primary tumor. Early dissemination of tumor cells followed by an extended period of dormancy is thought to explain this prevalent clinical behavior. By using a gain-of-function retroviral cDNA screen in the mouse, we found that Coco, a secreted antagonist of TGF-beta ligands, induces solitary mammary carcinoma cells that have extravasated in the lung stroma to exit from dormancy. more...

3944. Interplay between AP-1 and ERalpha in regulating gene expression and proliferation networks in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays an important role in breast cancer. Estrogen-dependent gene regulation by ERalpha can be mediated by interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1). The nature of such interactions in mediating the estrogen response in breast cancer cells remains unclear. Here we show that knockdown of c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, attenuates the expression of 37% of all estrogen-regulated genes, suggesting that AP-1 is a fundamental factor for ERalpha-mediated transcription. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tyrosine phosphorylation is a hallmark for activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins, but their transcriptional activity also depends on other secondary modifications. Type I interferons (IFNs) can activate both the ISGF3 (STAT1:STAT2:IRF9) complex and STAT3, but with cell-specific, selective triggering of only the ISGF3 transcriptional program. Following a genome-wide RNAi screen, we identified the Sin3a complex as an important mediator of this STAT3 transcriptional repression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Triple Negative Breast cancer accounts for some of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. By interrogating clinical datasets, we found that the activities of p63 and Hypoxia-Inducible-Factors (HIFs), two master regulators of the invasive and metastatic cancer cell phenotype are  linked in TNBC through the p63-target Sharp1. Mechanistically, Sharp1 promotes HIF-1α/HIF-2α proteasomal degradation by serving as HIFs presenting factor to the proteasome independently from oxygen levels and prior ubiquitination. more...

Here, we have examined histopathological data and generated gene expression data in two independent cohorts of primary tumors from HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients. We report that the combination of estrogen receptor (ER) negativity and expression of a novel 13-gene signature identify a subset of patients with rapid (median, 31 and 41 months in discovery and validation cohorts, respectively) versus slower (median, 66 months and 77 months in discovery and validation cohorts, respectively) development of brain metastases (P<0.0001). more...

(Submitter supplied) The initiation of breast cancer is associated with increased expression of tumor-promoting estrogen receptor α (ERα) protein and decreased expression of tumor-suppressive ERβ protein. However, the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. Here we show that Pescadillo/PES1, an estrogen-inducible protein that is over-expressed in breast cancer, can regulate the balance between ERα and ERβ. PES1 enhances transcriptional activity of ERα and reduces that of ERβ, and modulates many estrogen-responsive genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in diverse cellular physiology by controlling down-stream target genes. It has been well recognized that TFs are attractive target for treating human cancer since transcriptional activity or gene expression level of TFs can be directly modulated. To explore which TF functions as survival factor in human breast cancer, we applied gene expression data sets for survival analysis. more...

3987. Breast cancer cells resistant to hormone deprivation maintain an estrogen receptor alpha-dependent, E2F-directed transcriptional program
(Submitter supplied) A significant fraction of breast cancers exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to estrogen deprivation. To model resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) derivatives of MCF-7 and HCC-1428 cells were generated through culture for 3 and 7 months under hormone-depleted conditions, respectively. These LTED cells showed sensitivity to the ER downregulator fulvestrant under hormone-depleted conditions, suggesting continued dependence upon ER signaling for hormone-independent growth. more...

3989. Expression analysis of tumor microenvironment in triple-negative breast carcinoma in xenograft model
(Submitter supplied) Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family, exists and functions wholly within the tumor microenvironment to suppress tumorigenesis by directly targeting and antagonizing multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR and Met. This leads to potent and sustained signal attenuation, growth arrest, and angiostasis. We thus sought to evaluate the tumoricidal benefits of systemic decorin on a triple-negative orthotopic breast carcinoma xenograft model. more...

3998. Gene expression profiles of triple-negative breast cancer cells under the condition of 3D proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, the genes which relate to promote tumor aggressiveness in TNBC remain unclear. In order to investigate specific genes and pathways involved in TNBC tumorigenesis, we compared genes differentially expressed between 3D cultures (3DC) or tumor xenograft models and control two-dimensional cultures (2DC).

4025. Characterization and clinical evaluation of CD10+ stroma cells in the breast cancer microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: There is growing evidence that interaction between stromal and tumor cells is pivotal in breast cancer progression and response to therapy. Since the pioneer work of Allinen et al. suggested that during breast cancer progression striking changes occur in CD10+ stromal cells, we aimed to better characterize this cell population and its clinical relevance. Results: This 12-gene CD10+ stroma signature includes among others genes involved in matrix remodeling (MMP11, MMP13, COL10A1) and genes related to osteoblast differentiation (periostin). more...

4026. FOXA1 actively represses the molecular phenotype of basal breast cancers.
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of at least five major subtypes. Luminal subtype tumors confer a more favorable patient prognosis, which is in part, attributed to the Estrogen Receptor-α (ER) positivity and anti-hormone responsiveness of these tumors. Expression of the forkhead box transcription factor, FOXA1, also correlates with the luminal subtype and patient survival, but is present in a subset of ER-negative tumors. more...

4062. Alterations in tumour necrosis factor signaling pathways associated with cytotoxicity and resistance to taxanes in tumour cells.
(Submitter supplied) The taxanes are widely used in the treatment of breast and other cancers.  While their cytotoxicity has been attributed to the induction of cell cycle arrest in mitosis through the stabilization of microtubules, we found that docetaxel promotes soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha production in MCF-7 breast tumor cells.  TNF-alpha induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types by binding to one of its receptors (TNFR1) which promotes death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation. more...

4065. Integration of BRCA1-mediated miRNA and mRNA signatures reveal miR-146a, miR-99b and miR-205 regulation of the TRAF2 and NFkB pathways (mRNA dataset)
(Submitter supplied) BRCA1 deregulation is a frequent event in the pathogenesis of breast as well as other cancers. In addition to the DNA repair functions of BRCA1, it is involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as cell cycle, chromatin remodeling or transcription. However, the molecular events underlying BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In order to deepen our understanding of BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis, we integrated data from mRNA and miRNA microarray experiments on the HCC1937 breast cancer cell line, and the isogenic HCC1937 stably expressing BRCA1, to obtain significant miRNA-mRNA relationships associated to the presence of the BRCA1 gene. more...

4068. Maintenance of Hormone Responsiveness in Luminal Breast Cancers by Suppression of Notch
(Submitter supplied) Luminal breast cancers express estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) receptors and respond to hormone therapies. Basal-like “triple negative” (TN) cancers lack steroid receptors but are cytokeratin (CK) 5-positive and require chemotherapy. Here we show that over half of primary ER+PR+ breast cancers contain an ER–PR–CK5+ “luminobasal” subpopulation exceeding 1% of cells. Starting from ER+PR+ luminal cell lines, we generated novel lines with varying luminal to luminobasal-cell ratios and studied their molecular and biological properties. more...

Whether such cancer stem/progenitor cells originate from normal stem cells based on initiation of a de novo stem cell program, by reprogramming of a more differentiated cell type by oncogenic insults or both remains unresolved.  A major hurdle in addressing these issues is lack of immortal human stem/progenitor cells that can be deliberately manipulated in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer is a curable disease if it is diagnosed at an early stage.  However, only little options are left once the tumor is metastasized to distant organs, and more than 90% of breast cancer death is attributed to metastatic disease.  The process of metastasis is highly complex and involves many steps for successful colonization of tumor cells at a target organ.  According to the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory, which still remains a hypothesis, these metastatic cells must have stem cell-like capability for their self-renewal in addition to their invasive ability. more...

(Submitter supplied) Paired FNA and CBX specimens were prospectively collected from 37 breast cancers before any systemic therapy during a biomarker discovery study at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We identified 293 probe sets overexpressed in core biopsies; these included five highly  coexpressed gene clusters (metagenes) corresponding to immune functions and extracellular  matrix components. We compared gene expression profiles of pairs of fine-needle (stroma-poor) and core-needle (stroma-rich) biopsies from 37 cancers to identify stroma-associated genes

4099. Role of S100A7 in regulating inflammatory pathways during mammary tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) Psoriasin (S100A7) has been shown to be highly expressed in invasive estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. Expression of S100A7 in human breast tumors represents a poor prognostic marker and correlates with lymphocyte infiltration in high-grade morphology. Recent studies have shown that S100A7 downregulation in ERα- cells lines inhibits tumor growth in in vivo mouse model systems. However, not much is known about its mechanisms in regulating breast cancers. more...

4113. Methylation specifies distinct estrogen-induced binding site repertoires of CBP to chromatin (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Multiple signaling pathways ultimately modulate the epigenetic information embedded in the chromatin of gene promoters by recruiting epigenetic enzymes. We found that, in estrogen-regulated gene programming, the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) is specifically and exclusively methylated by the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (CARM1) in vivo. CARM1-dependent CBP methylation and p160 coactivators were required for estrogen-induced recruitment to chromatin targets. more...

4118. A new gene expression signature, the ClinicoMolecular Triad Classification, may improve prediction and prognostication of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis
(Submitter supplied) When making treatment decisions, oncologists often stratify breast cancers into a low-risk group (ER+, low grade); an intermediate-risk group (ER+, high grade); and a high-risk group that includes Her2+ and triple-negative (ER-/PR-/Her2-) tumors. None of the currently available gene signatures correlates to this clinical classification. We aimed to develop a test that is practical for the oncologists, that offers both molecular characterization of BCs, and improved prediction of prognosis and treatment response. more...

Glycans can play an important role in metastasis through their interactions with glycan binding proteins. Moreover we, and others have also shown that expression of particular tumor-associated glycoforms of the mucin MUC1, allows it to interact with lectins of the immune system. more...

We investigated whether prolonged continuous selection of cells for drug resistance enriches cultures for cancer stem-like cells. Methods: Cancer stem cells were defined as CD44+/CD24– cells that could self-renew (ie, generate cells with the tumorigenic CD44+/CD24– phenotype), differentiate, invade, and form tumors in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) Human breast cancers are broadly classified based on their gene expression profiles into luminal- and basal-type tumors. These two major tumor subtypes express markers corresponding to the major differentiation states of epithelial cells in the breast, luminal (EpCAM+) and basal/myoepithelial (ME, CD10+). However, there are also rare types of breast cancers, such as metaplastic carcinomas, where tumor cells exhibit features of alternate cell types that no longer resemble breast epithelium. more...

(Submitter supplied) Despite the role of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) pathway as a key growth driver for breast cells, the phenotypic consequence of exogenous introduction of ERalpha into ERalpha-negative cells paradoxically has been growth inhibition. We map the binding profiles of ERalpha and its interacting transcription factors (TFs), FOXA1 and GATA3 in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We observe that these three TFs form a functional enhanceosome and cooperatively modulate the transcriptional networks previously ascribed to ERalpha alone. more...

(Submitter supplied) INTRODUCTION. Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. more...

4137. Expression profile of miR-101 transfection in MCF-7 cells compared with scramble control
(Submitter supplied) Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of cellular self-digestion in which proteins and organelles are degraded through delivery to lysosomes. Defects in this process are implicated in numerous human diseases including cancer. To further elucidate regulatory mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a functional screen in search of microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate the autophagic flux in breast cancer cells. more...

4139. Generation of tumor initiating cells by exogenous delivery of OCT4 transcription factor
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are being extensively studied for their role in tumor etiology, maintenance and resistance to treatment. The isolation of TICs has been limited by the scarcity of this population in the tissue of origin and because the molecular signatures that characterize these cells are not well understood. Herein, we describe the generation of TIC-like cell lines by ectopic expression of the OCT4 transcription factor (TF) in primary breast cell preparations. more...

4141. Context-Specific Regulation of NF-κB Target Gene Expression by EZH2 in Breast Cancers
(Submitter supplied) Both EZH2 and NF-κB contribute to aggressive breast cancer, yet whether the two oncogenic factors have functional cross-talk in breast cancer is largely unknown. Here, we uncover an unexpected role of EZH2 in conferring the constitutive activation of NF-κB target gene expression in ER-negative basal-like breast cancer cells.  This function of EZH2 is independent of its histone methyltransferase activity but requires the physical interaction with RelA/RelB to promote the expression of NF-κB targets. more...

(Submitter supplied) But4ManNAc - an analog of ManNAc, the committed precursor of sialic acid - decreases metastatic potential, inhibits growth, and triggers apoptosis in many cancer cells. The anti-tumor effects of But4ManNAc may result from a synergistic interaction between butyrate-induced changes in gene expression and ManNAc-induced altered sialylation.  This experiment provides insight into synergistic interactions by identifying changes in gene expression specific to But4ManNAc and not shared with butyrate.

4181. Activator protein-2γ is a critical determinant of estrogen receptor interactome formation and gene transcription in breast cancer [expression]
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is key player in the progression of breast cancer. ERα binds to DNA and mediates long-range chromatin interactions throughout the genome, but the underlying mechanism in this process is unclear. Here, we show that AP-2 motifs are highly enriched in the ERα binding sites (ERBS) identified from the recent ChIA-PET of ERα. More importantly, we demonstrate that AP-2γ (also known as TFAP2C), a member of the AP-2 family which has been implicated in breast cancer oncogenesis, is recruited to chromatin in a ligand-independent manner and co-localized with ERα binding events. more...

4182. Proteolytic inactivation of the autoinhibitory prodomain is essential for the pro-tumorigenic function of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)
(Submitter supplied) Invasive cancers employ pericellular proteolysis to breach the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers and invade the surrounding tissue. Pro-invasive, pro-tumorigenic MT1-MMP is the primary mediator of proteolytic events on the cancer cell surface. Cellular MT1-MMP is synthesized as a latent zymogen. The latency of MT1-MMP is maintained by its N-terminal inhibitory prodomain. Our study reveals a critical mechanism underlying the activation pathway and subsequent execution of the tumor-promoting function of MT1-MMP. more...

(Submitter supplied) Understanding the molecular underpinnings of chemoresistance is vital to design therapies to restore chemosensitivity. In particular, metadherin (MTDH) has been demonstrated to have a critical role in chemoresistance. Over-expression of MTDH has recently been implicated in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, neroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. In this present study, we focused on the therapeutic benefit of MTDH depletion to restore sensitivity to cell death mediated by a combinatorial therapy of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which promotes death of cancerous cells of the human reproductive tract, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which have been shown to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Promoter methylation was assayed in a number of breast cancer and control normal samples along with the effects of 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on breast cancer cell line transcriptomes.  Aberrant promoter hypermethylation is frequently observed in cancer. The potential for this to contribute to tumour development depends on whether the genes affected are repressed because of their methylation. Many aberrantly methylated genes play important roles in development and are bivalently marked in ES cells suggesting that their aberrant methylation may reflect developmental processes. more...

However, the relevance of estrogen receptor-beta in mediating endoxifen action has yet to be explored.  Therefore, the goals of this study were to determine the differences in the global gene expression profiles elicited by estradiol treatment and endoxifen between parental MCF7 breast cancer cells (expressing estrogen receptor alpha only) and MCF7 cells stably expressing estrogen receptor beta.

4236. Expression of microRNAs and their gene targets are dysregulated in pre-invasive breast cancer (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression and may play a causal role in invasive breast cancer. Since many genetic aberrations of invasive disease are detectable in earlier stages, we hypothesized that miRNA expression dysregulation and the predicted changes in gene expression would also be found in early breast neoplasias.   Methods: Expression profiling of 365 miRNAs by RT-qPCR was combined with laser-capture microdissection to obtain an epithelial specific miRNA expression signature of normal breast epithelium (n=9) and of paired samples of histologically normal epithelium (HN) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n=16). more...

4251. High-throughput ectopic expression screen for tamoxifen resistance
(Submitter supplied) Resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer patients is a serious therapeutic problem and major efforts are underway to understand underlying mechanisms. Resistance can be either intrinsic or acquired. We derived a series of subcloned MCF7 cell lines that were either highly sensitive or naturally resistant to tamoxifen and studied the factors that lead to drug resistance. Gene-expression studies revealed a signature of 67 genes that differentially respond to tamoxifen in sensitive vs. more...

4256. Identification of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in triple negative breast cancer as a novel target for the human miR-34a microRNA (gene expression)
(Submitter supplied) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is histologically characterized by the absence of the hormone receptors estrogen and progesterone, in addition to having a negative immunostain for HER-2.  The aggressiveness of this disease and lack of targeted therapeutic options for treatment is of high clinical importance.  MicroRNAs are short 21- to 23 nucleotide endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA transcripts, resulting in either decreased protein translation or mRNA degradation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy, however resistance is common in ERα-positive tumors that over-express the growth factor receptor ERBB2. Even in the absence of estrogen, ERα can be activated by growth factors including the epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen, however the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown. more...

4265. Expression data from MTDH knockdown in the Hec50co endometrial cancer cell line
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the molecular underpinnings of chemoresistance is vital to design therapies to restore chemosensitivity. In particular, metadherin (MTDH) has been demonstrated to have a critical role in chemoresistance. Over-expression of MTDH has recently been implicated in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, neroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. In this present study, we focused on the therapeutic benefit of MTDH depletion to restore sensitivity to cell death mediated by a combinatorial therapy of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which promotes death of cancerous cells of the human reproductive tract, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which have been shown to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. more...

Despite this progress, however, resistance to trastuzumab occurs in the vast majority of patients. Newer anti-HER2 therapies, like the dual tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib, show antitumor activity in a limited proportion of patients, indicating that HER2 can be still exploited as a target after trastuzumab failure. more...

4289. Using a Stem Cell-Based Signature to Guide Therapeutic Selection in Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Given the very substantial heterogeneity of most human cancers, it is likely that most cancer therapeutics will be active in only a small fraction of any population of patients. As such, the development of new therapeutics, coupled with methods to match a therapy with the individual patient, will be critical to achieving significant gains in disease outcome. One such opportunity is the use of expression signatures to identify key oncogenic phenotypes that can serve not only as biomarkers but also as a means of identifying therapeutic compounds that might specifically target these phenotypes. more...

4291. Tumor Suppressor Role for the c-Myb Oncogene in Luminal Breast Cancer
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND: The transcription factor c-Myb has been well characterized as an oncogene in several human tumor types, and its expression in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell population is essential for proper hematopoiesis. However, the role of c-Myb in mammopoeisis and breast tumorigenesis is poorly understood, despite its high expression in the majority of breast cancer cases (60-80%). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We find that c-Myb high expression in human breast tumors correlates with the luminal/ER+ phenotype and a good prognosis. more...

4329. Effect of radiation and cigarette smoke on breast cells
(Submitter supplied) Exposure to genotoxic stresses such as cosmic radiation and second-hand tobacco smoke may increase the risk of breast cancer formation. Towards an understanding of how exposure to these genotoxic agents affect breast cancer biogenesis, we have shown that treating non-tumorigenic immortalized breast MCF 10A cells with low doses (0.1 Gray) of radiation as well as cigarette smoke condensate can generate a neoplastic breast cancer phenotype. more...

4330. Dynamic changes in gene expression in vivo predict prognosis of tamoxifen-treated patients with breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Tamoxifen is the most widely prescribed anti-estrogen treatment for patients with ER-positive breast cancer. However, there is still a need for biomarkers that reliably predict endocrine sensitivity in breast cancers and these may well be expressed in a dynamic manner.   In this study we assessed gene expression changes at multiple time points (days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14) after tamoxifen treatment in the ER-positive ZR-75-1 xenograft model that displays significant changes in apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis within 2 days of therapy. more...

4331. The anti-proliferative effects of progestins in T47D breast cancer cells are tempered by progestin-induction of the ETS transcription factor Elf5.
(Submitter supplied) Prolactin and progesterone act together to regulate mammary alveolar development, and both hormones have been implicated in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here we show that Elf5, a prolactin-induced ETS transcription factor that specifies the mammary secretory cell lineage, is also induced by progestins in breast cancer cells via a direct mechanism. To define the transcriptional response to progestin elicited via Elf5 we made an inducible Elf5 sh-RNA knock down model in T47D breast cancer cells and used it to prevent the progestin-induction of Elf5. more...

(Submitter supplied) Retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR alpha) is a known estrogen target gene in breast cancer cells. The consequence of RAR alpha induction by estrogen was previously unknown. We now show that RAR alpha is required for efficient estrogen receptor-alpha (ER)-mediated transcription and cell proliferation. RAR alpha can interact with ER-binding sites, but this occurs in an ER-dependent manner, providing a novel role for RAR alpha that is independent of its classic role. more...

There are many thousands of formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival blocks collected around the world, but in contrast relatively few fresh frozen samples in tumor banks. Once samples are fixed in formalin the RNA is degraded and traditional methods for gene expression profiling are not suitable.

4343. Time-dependent expressed markers and their characterization for premature senescence induced by ionizing radiation in MCF7
(Submitter supplied) Recently, senescence has been suggested as a defense mechanism to block sporadic induction of cancer cells. Radiation treatment induces proliferating cancer cells to turn into non-proliferating senescent cells in vitro. To characterize transcriptional reprogramming after radiation treatment, we measured the gene expression profiles of MCF7 at different time points after treatment. In these experiments, we found that IR induced premature senescence in MCF7 cells, and IR treatment resulted in significant changes in the expression of 305 marker genes (less than 1% FDR), which were strongly correlated (|r|>0.9) with IR treatment in a time-dependent manner. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pre-mRNA splicing is functionally coupled to transcription, and genotoxic stresses can enhance alternative exon inclusion by affecting elongating RNA polymerase II. We report here that various genotoxic stress inducers, including camptothecin, inhibit the interaction between EWS, an RNA polymerase II-associated factor, and YB-1, a spliceosome-associated factor. This results in the cotranscriptional skipping of several exons of the MDM2 gene encoding the main p53 ubiquitin-ligase. more...

(Submitter supplied) Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a p53-dependent defence mechanism against uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, many human tumours harbour p53 mutations while others show a dysfunctional p53 pathway, frequently by unknown mechanisms. We identified BRD7, a bromodomain-containing protein whose inhibition allows full neoplastic transformation in the presence of wild-type p53. Intriguingly, in human breast tumours harbouring wild-type, but not mutant p53, the BRD7 gene locus was frequently deleted and low BRD7 expression was found in a subgroup of tumours. more...

4364. Multi-level Support Vector Regression analysis to identify condition-specific regulatory networks
(Submitter supplied) The identification of gene regulatory modules is an important yet challenging problem in computational biology. While many computational methods have been proposed to identify regulatory modules, their initial  success is largely compromised by a high rate of false positives, especially when applied to human cancer studies. New strategies are needed for reliable regulatory module identification. We present a new approach, namely multi-level support vector regression (ml-SVR), to systematically identify conditionspecific regulatory modules. more...

4401. Rapamycin treatment of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line and MDA-MB-468 xenografts
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways promoting tumor growth. mTOR is aberrantly activated in a significant portion of breast cancers and is a promising target for treatment. Rapamycin and its analogues are in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment. Patterns of gene expression (metagenes) may also be used to simulate a biologic process of effects of a drug treatment. more...

4402. Loss of Syk in normal breast cells
(Submitter supplied) Loss of Syk in normal breast cells in vivo and in vitro:  gene expression and phenotypic switch to stem-cell like with induction of invadopodia  Morphological and gene microarray analysis following Syk knockdown in MCF10A reveals a loss of luminal and differentiated epithelial features with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and a gain in invadopodia and stem/ progenitor cell marker expression.  These results support the role of Syk in limiting normal stem/progenitor proliferation and invasion during morphogenesis, and support the role of Syk as a critical tumor suppressor for breast cancer.

4403. The biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlate with their cancer stem cell content
(Submitter supplied) Pathways that govern normal stem cell (SC) function are often subverted in cancer. Here, we report the isolation to near purity of human normal mammary SC (hNMSCs), from cultured mammospheres, based on their ability to retain the lipophilic dye PKH26 as a consequence of their quiescent nature. We demonstrated that PKH26-positive cells possess all the characteristics of hNMSCs. The transcriptional profile of PKH26-positive cells (hNMSC signature) was able to predict biological and molecular features of breast cancers. more...

(Submitter supplied) Uterine leiomyomata (UL), the most common neoplasm in reproductive-age women, have recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities including del(7)(q22q32).  To develop a molecular signature, matched del(7q) and non-del(7q) tumors identified by FISH or karyotyping from 11 women were profiled with expression arrays.  Our analysis using paired t-tests demonstrates this matched design is critical to eliminate confounding effects of genotype and environment that underlie patient variation. more...

4440. Role of FAK, dominant-negative FAK, FAK-CD and FAKsiRNA in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell tumorigenesis
(Submitter supplied) Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in proliferation, motility, adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, and survival signaling. Focal adhesion kinase has been shown to be overexpressed in many types of tumors, including breast cancer at early stages of tumorigenesis.  To study the biological role of FAK in breast tumorigenesis, we used FAKsiRNA to down-regulate FAK in MCF-7 cell lines.

4441. Letrozole (Femara) early response to treatment
(Submitter supplied) Tumorigenic breast cancer cells characterized by high CD44 and low or undetectable CD24 levels (CD44+/CD24-/low) may be resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for cancer relapse. We defined a “signature” expression pattern of hundreds of genes associated with CD44+/CD24-/low, mammosphere-forming cells. In a panel of patient breast tumors, this tumorigenic gene signature was found exclusively manifested in tumors of the recently identified “claudin-low” molecular profile subtype characterized by overexpression of many mesenchymal-associated genes, suggesting that these tumors have pre-existing higher levels of tumorigenic cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polycomb protein EZH2-mediated gene silencing is implicated in breast tumorigenesis through methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 27 (H3K27). We have previously shown that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) can modulate histone methylation and disrupt EZH2 complex. Here, we used DZNep, together with other chromatin remodeling agents, as well as RNA interference-mediated EZH2 depletion, to probe the role of EZH2 in coordination with other epigenetic components in gene regulation in breast cancer cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Instructive mechanisms are present for induction of DNA methylation, as shown by methylation of specific CpG islands (CGIs) by specific inducers and in specific cancers. However, instructive factors involved are poorly understood, except for involvement of low transcription and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Here, we used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with a CGI oligonucleotide microarray analysis, and identified 5510 and 521 genes with promoter CGIs resistant and susceptible, respectively, to DNA methylation in prostate cancer cell lines. more...

4455. Epigenetic signature of breast cancer and its association with gene expression and copy number
(Submitter supplied) Recent advances in multiple whole genome technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to profile epigenomic signatures in cancer cells. Previously we used a human gene promoter tiling microarray platform to identify genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a cell line model of breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, the clustered nature of epigenetic targets that we identified, along with our concurrent karyotype analyses, have now led us to hypothesize that complex genomic alterations in cancer cells (deletions, translocations and ploidy) may be superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints among breast cancer survivors, with a major negative impact on general life. However, the etiology behind this syndrome is still unraveled. Gene expression analysis was performed on whole blood samples from breast cancer survivors classified as either fatigued or non-fatigued at two consecutive time points. The analysis identified several gene sets concerning plasma and B cell pathways as different between the fatigue and non-fatigue groups, suggesting that a deregulation in these pathways might underlie the fatigue syndrome. more...

4477. Expression data from MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells
(Submitter supplied) SOX genes encode a family of high-mobility group transcription factors that play critical roles in organogenesis. Virtually all members of SOX family have been found to be deregulated in tumors of various origins. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviours involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, and molecular profiling revealed that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through its transcription regulation of cell cycle related genes in breast cancer cells Keywords: Gene Transfection

Since chemokines and their receptors function in chemotaxis of metastatic cells, we hypothesized that LAM cells may be recruited by chemokine(s) in the lung.  Quantification of 25 chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from LAM patients and healthy volunteers revealed that concentrations of MCP-1/CCL2, GROa/CXCL1 and ENA-78/CXCL5 were significantly higher in samples from LAM patients than healthy volunteers. more...

4517. Contribution of HSD17B12 for estradiol biosynthesis in human breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type12 (HSD17B12) has been demonstrated to be involved in regulation of in situ biosynthesis of estradiol (E2). HSD17B12 expression was reported in breast carcinomas but its functions have remained unknown. Therefore, we examined the correlation between mRNA expression profiles determined by microarray analysis and tissue E2 concentrations obtained from 16 postmenopausal breast carcinoma cases in order to analyze an association of the enzyme expression with intratumoral E2 production. more...

4518. Synergy between plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and Snail in tumoral migration 
(Submitter supplied) Snail, a family of transcriptional repressors implicated in cell movement, has been correlated with tumour invasivity. The Plasminogen Activation system (PAs), including urokinase (uPA), its receptor (uPAR), and its inhibitor (PAI-1), also plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, either through proteolytic degradation or by non proteolytic modulation of cell adhesion and migration. Thus, Snail and PAs both influence those processes and are over-expressed in cancers. more...

4519. Identification of transcriptional changes induced by FHIT in lung cancer cells NCI-H460
(Submitter supplied) The FHIT gene, at 3p14.2, encompasses the common fragile site FRA3B and is frequently inactivated in primary tumors and cell lines of lung, head and neck, stomach, esophagus, cervix and breast cancer. In particular, loss of the FHIT protein is one of the most frequent alteration in lung tumors and pre-invasive lung lesions, suggesting a role for this gene in the early stages of lung carcinogenesis. Adenoviral-mediated restoration of FHIT expression in FHIT-negative cell lines results in cell cycle alteration, induction of apoptosis (through activation of the cytoplasmic apoptotic pathway) and regression of the tumorigenic phenotype. Taken together these observations support the hypothesis of a role for FHIT in human carcinogenesis, but little is known about its mechanism of action. Identification of transcriptional targets of FHIT is therefore critical to understand the pathways by which FHIT promotes growth arrest and apoptosis.

4553. Differential expression of 24,426 human alternative splicing events and predicted cis-regulation in 48 tissues
(Submitter supplied) Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing impacts development, physiology, and disease, but its regulation in humans is not well understood, partially due to the limited scale to which the expression of specific splicing events has been measured.  We generated the first genome-scale expression compendium of human alternative splicing events using custom whole-transcript microarrays monitoring expression of 24,426 mutually exclusive alternative splicing event pairs in 48 diverse human samples. more...

4554. A six-gene signature predicting breast cancer lung metastasis
(Submitter supplied) The lungs are a frequent target of metastatic breast cancer cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. All existing data were obtained either using statistical association between gene expression measurements found in primary tumors and clinical outcome, or using experimentally derived signatures from mouse tumor models. Here, we describe a distinct approach that consists to utilize tissue surgically resected from lung metastatic lesions and compare their gene expression profiles with those from non-pulmonary sites, all coming from breast cancer patients. more...

4557. A Precisely Regulated Gene Expression Cassette Potently Modulates Metastasis and Survival in Multiple Solid Cancers
(Submitter supplied) Successful carcinogenesis involves the integration of both pro- and anti-oncogenic pathways. We postulated that genes critical for balancing these opposing pathways are likely to be precisely controlled in tumors, since even subtle alterations in their activity might cause substantial alterations in tumor growth and survival. Using a novel genomic approach, we identified a 48-gene “Poised Gene Cassette” (PGC) showing tight regulation specifically in human cancers but not in corresponding nonmalignant tissues. more...

(Submitter supplied) The biological functions of nuclear topoisomerase I (Top1) have been difficult to study because knocking out TOP1 is lethal in metazoans. To reveal the functions of human Top1, we have generated stable Top1siRNA cell lines from colon and breast carcinomas (HCT116-siTop1 and MCF-7-siTop1, respectively). In those cells, Top2 compensates for Top1 deficiency. A prominent feature of the siTop1 cells is genomic instability, with chromosomal aberrations and histone gamma-H2AX foci associated with replication. more...

The "rules" governing which genes are methylated during the pathogenesis of individual cancers, how specific methylation profiles are initially established, or what determines tumor type-specific methylation are unknown. However, DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and sensitive for common tumors would be useful for the early detection of cancer, and those required for the malignant phenotype would identify pathways important as therapeutic targets. more...

4627. XBP1 confers estrogen independence and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cell lines
(Submitter supplied) Human X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) is an alternatively spliced transcription factor that participates in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress signaling pathway that allows cells to survive the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.  We have previously demonstrated that XBP1 expression is increased in antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cell lines, and is co-expressed with estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in breast tumors. more...

We characterized the molecular changes induced by docetaxel in two well-known human breast carcinoma cell lines. Two mechanisms of action according to drug concentration were suggested by a biphasic sensitivity curve, and were further validated by cell morphology, cell cycle and cell death changes. more...

4667. A Genome-wide Screen for Hypermethylated Genes in Lung Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Abstract Background:  Promoter hypermethylation coupled with loss of heterozygosity at the same locus results in loss of gene function in many tumor cells.  The “rules” governing which genes are methylated during the pathogenesis of individual cancers, how specific methylation profiles are initially established, or what determines tumor-type specific methylation are unknown.  However, DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and sensitive for common tumors would be useful for the early detection of cancer, and those required for the malignant phenotype identify pathways important as therapeutic targets. more...

4705. Effects of Estrogen and Tamoxifen on Ishikawa cells after 24h and 48h
(Submitter supplied) Treatment with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen confers a risk of developing uterine tumors or other endometrial pathologies.  Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which demonstrates tissue-specific activity although the mechanisms remain poorly understood.  Both estradiol and tamoxifen act as estrogen agonists on the human uterus, and therefore have the potential to promote carcinogenicity. more...

4747. Cell-type specific responses to chemotherapeutics in breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Recent studies have identified clinical subtypes of breast tumors that arise from different cell types and have different outcomes in response to chemotherapy.  Tumors derived from basal epithelium have a poorer prognosis than tumors derived from luminal epithelium.  To gain insight into differences underlying this disparity, we treated cell lines derived from basal epithelium (immortalized human mammary epithelial cells) and those derived from luminal epithelium (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1) with two chemotherapeutics commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. more...

4751. DACH1 inhibits TGF-beta signaling through binding Smad4
(Submitter supplied) The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS-domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. more...

4755. Human cancer cell lines
(Submitter supplied) We used cDNA microarrays to explore the variation in expression of approximately 8,000 unique genes among the 60 cell lines used in the National Cancer Institute's screen for anti-cancer drugs. Classification of the cell lines based solely on the observed patterns of gene expression revealed a correspondence to the ostensible origins of the tumors from which the cell lines were derived. The consistent relationship between the gene expression patterns and the tissue of origin allowed us to recognize outliers whose previous classification appeared incorrect. more...
