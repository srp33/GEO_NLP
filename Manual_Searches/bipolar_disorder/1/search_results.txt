(Submitter supplied) Bipolar disorder (BD) has an estimated heritability of about 80%. Different pathways and candidate genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BD, but definite mechanisms are yet unresolved. In a previous study, we identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4500567, located in the upstream region of Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8), to be associated with bipolar disorder (BD). The SNP´s minor allele results in a predicted binding site for the transcription factor Nuclear Factor Interleukin 3, regulated (NFIL3); luciferase assays confirmed allele-specific TSPAN8 expression levels.

41. Total RNAseq of human putamen and caudate nucleus tissues in healthy control and Bipolar Disorder individuals
(Submitter supplied) A multitude of genes have been associated with bipolar disorder via SNP genotyping studies.  However, many of these associated SNPs are found within intronic or intergenic regions of the human genome.  We were interested in studying transcriptional profiles/splice variation of genes associated with bipolar disorder within the human striatum. Understanding how these associated genes are transcribed in the human brain may help to guide the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.

42. Gene expression of L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in the DLPFC comparing schizophrenia from bipolar major depressive disorders and unaffected subjects.
(Submitter supplied) Impairments in certain cognitive processes (e.g., working memory) are typically most pronounced in schizophrenia (SZ), intermediate in bipolar disorder (BP) and least in major depressive disorder (MDD). Given that working memory depends, in part, on neural circuitry that includes pyramidal neurons in layer 3 (L3) and layer 5 (L5) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we sought to determine if transcriptome alterations in these neurons were shared or distinctive for each diagnosis.

44. Inference of cell-type composition from human brain transcriptomic datasets illuminates the effects of age, manner of death, dissection, and psychiatric diagnosis
(Submitter supplied) Most neuroscientists would agree that psychiatric illness is unlikely to arise from pathological changes that occur uniformly across all cells in a given brain region. Despite this fact, the majority of transcriptomic analyses of the human brain to date are conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of conducting single-cell level analyses on donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary brain cell types identified in published single cell type transcriptomic experiments. more...

45. Systematically characterizing dysfunctional long intergenic non-coding RNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis
(Submitter supplied) Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are severe neuropsychiatric disorders with serious impact on patients, together termed “major psychosis”. Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) were reported to play important roles in mental diseases. However, little was known about their molecular mechanism in pathogenesis of SZ and BD. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on 82 post-mortem brain tissues from three brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)) of patients with SZ and BD and control subjects, generating over one billion reads. more...

73. Gene expression from human prefrontal cortex (BA46)
(Submitter supplied) Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). We performed large-scale DNA microarray analysis of postmortem brains of patients with BD or SZ, and examined expression patterns of mitochondria-related genes. We found a global down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, such as those encoding respiratory chain components, in BD and SZ samples, even after the effect of sample pH was controlled. more...

74. Expression Profiles of Monozygotic Twin
(Submitter supplied) The expression level for 15 887 transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 19 monozygotic twin pairs (10 male, 9 female) were analysed for the effects of genotype and sex. On an average, the effect of twin pairs explained 31% of the variance in normalized gene expression levels, consistent with previous broad sense heritability estimates. The effect of sex on gene expression levels was most noticeable on the X chromosome, which contained 15 of the 20 significantly differentially expressed genes. more...

75. Expression profiling in monozygotic twins discordant for bipolar disorder
(Submitter supplied) To identify genes dysregulated in bipolar disorder (BD1) we carried out global gene expression profiling using whole-genome microarrays. To minimize genetic variation in gene expression levels between cases and controls we compared expression profiles in lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the disease. We identified 82 genes that were differentially expressed by ≥ 1.3-fold in 3 BD1 cases compared to their co-twins, and which were statistically (p ≤ 0.05) differentially expressed between the groups of BD1 cases and controls. more...

76. Expression profiling of human adult postmortem brain tissue from subjects with bipolar disorder and healthy controls
(Submitter supplied) Bipolar affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component but unknown pathophysiology. We used microarray technology (Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips) to determine the expression of approximately 22 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex) from patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. more...
