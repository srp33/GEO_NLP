4. Transcriptional Consequences of Trisomy 21 on Neural Induction
(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome, caused by trisomy 21, is a complex developmental disorder associated with intellectual disability and reduced growth of multiple organs. Structural pathologies are present at birth, reflecting embryonic origins. A fundamental unanswered question is how an extra copy of human chromosome 21 contributes to organ-specific pathologies that characterize individuals with Down syndrome. Relevant to the hallmark intellectual disability in Down syndrome, how does trisomy 21 affect neural development? We tested the hypothesis that trisomy 21 exerts effects on human neural development as early as neural induction. more...

(Submitter supplied) Patients with Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21, T21) are at increased risk of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (ML-DS). Both TAM and ML-DS require prenatal somatic mutations in GATA1, resulting in the truncated isoform GATA1s.  The mechanism by which individual chromosome 21 (HSA21) genes synergize with GATA1s for leukemic transformation is challenging to study, in part due to limited human cell models with wild type GATA1 or GATA1s. more...

16. Mediator kinase inhibition suppresses hyperactive interferon signaling in Down syndrome
(Submitter supplied) Individuals with Down syndrome have a increased likelihood of suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, due to the presence of four interferon receptors on chromosome 21. Transcription of genes plays a key role in the interferon response, and the Mediator kinases, CDK8 and CDK19, are essential in potentiating this transcription. Given the role CDK8/19 play in the interferon response, and the fact that selective inhibitors of these kinases exist (such as Cortistatin A), it is possible that targetting Mediator kinase activity may alleviate symptoms of chronic inflammation in Down syndrome.

(Submitter supplied) Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are very frequent in children with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21). However, the mechanisms by which T21 causes susceptibility to CHDs are poorly understood. Here, using a combination of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model and Dp(16)1Yey/+ (Dp16) a mouse model of DS, we identified downregulation of canonical Wnt signaling that is caused by increased dosage of interferon (IFN) receptors encoded on chromosome 21 (HSA21) as a causative factor of CHDs in DS. more...

29. Chromatin occupancy and chromatin status of K562 cells with a mutation causing exclusive expression of N-terminally truncated GATA1 (GATA1s).
(Submitter supplied) Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). GATA1 gene mutations are detected in almost all TAM and DS-AMKL samples, leading to exclusive expression of short GATA1 protein (GATA1s) lacking of N-terminal domain (NTD). However, it remains to be clarified how GATA1s is involved with both disorders. To investigate how the loss of GATA1 NTD is involved in the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis in DS, we established the K562 GATA1s (K562-G1s) clones expressing only GATA1s by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. more...

45. Modeling Down syndrome AML by introducing disese-specific mutations in iPSCs
(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome AML is characterized by the presence of the pathgnonomic mutation in GATA1, which cooperates with other somatic mutations. In this study, we utilzed iPSCs derived from Down syndrome individuals bearing trisomy 21 and introduced disease-specific mutations using CRISPR-Cas9. Hematopoeitic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) obtained by hematopoeitic differentiation of these iPSCs, and megakaryocytes generated from the HSPCs (by culturing in megakaryocyte-specific media) were used for RNA sequencing analysis.

Despite the limited success of current pharmacological interventions, little has been achieved to reverse the abnormal brain developmental in DS. Here, using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based brain organoid and in vivo human neuronal chimeric mouse brain models, we demonstrate that the HSA21 genes OLIG1 and OLIG2 exhibit distinct temporal expression patterns during neuronal differentiation. more...

108. caArray_orkin-0038: Identification of distinct molecular phenotypes in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling
(Submitter supplied) Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are predisposed to develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), characterized by expression of truncated GATA1 transcription factor protein (GATA1s) due to somatic mutation. The treatment outcome for DS-AMKL is more favorable than for AMKL in non-DS patients. To gain insight into gene expression differences in AMKL, we compared 24 DS and 39 non-DS AMKL samples. more...

109. Musashi-2 attenuates AHR signalling to expand human haematopoietic stem cells
(Submitter supplied) A greater understanding of the molecular pathways that underpin the unique human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal program will improve strategies to expand these critical cell types for regenerative therapies. The post-transcriptional mechanisms guiding HSPC fate during ex vivo expansion have not been closely investigated. Using shRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-2 (MSI2) is required for human HSPC self-renewal. more...

110. Longitudinal Gene Expression Analysis in Human Brain identifies biological processes underlying neuropathology in Down Syndrome
(Submitter supplied) Trisomy 21 (Ts21) or Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. To investigate the consequences of Ts21 on human brain development, we have systematically analyzed the transcriptome of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DFC) and cerebellar cortex (CBC) using exon array mapping in DS and matched euploid control brains spanning from prenatal development to adulthood. We identify hundreds of differentially expressed (DEX) genes in the DS brains, many of which exhibit temporal changes in expression over the lifespan. To gain insight into how these DEX genes may cause specific DS phenotypes, we identified functional modules of co-expressed genes using several different bioinformatics approaches, including WGCNA and gene ontology analysis.  A module comprised of genes associated with myelination, including those dynamically expressed over the course of oligodendrocyte development, was amongst those with the great levels of differential gene expression. Using Ts65Dn mouse line, the most common rodent  model of DS, w e observed significant and novel defects in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin ultrastructure; establishing  a correlative proof-of-principle implicating myelin dysgenesis in DS.  Thus, examination of the spatio-temporal transcriptome predicts specific cellular and functional events in the DS brain and is an outstanding resource for determining putative mechanisms involved in the neuropathology of DS.

(Submitter supplied) In this work we present an analytical strategy to systematically identify early regulators by combining gene regulatory networks (GRN) with GWAS.  We hypothesized that early regulators in T-cell associated diseases could be found by defining upstream transcription factors (TFs) in T-cell differentiation. Time series expression and DNA methylation profiling of T-cell differentiation identified several upstream TFs, of which TFs involved in Th1/2 differentiation were most enriched for disease associated SNPs identified by GWAS.

(Submitter supplied) The organization and dynamics of chromatin within the in vivo interphase nucleus and the latter's relationship with transcriptional regulation are still not fully understood. To better understand these relationships, we studied a natural example of chromosomal disorganization: aneuploidy due to trisomies 13, 18 and 21. We hypothesized that the presence of an extra copy of one chromosome alters the CT distribution in the nucleus, which in turn perturbs transcriptional activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome is a common disorder with enormous medical and social costs, caused by trisomy for Chr21. We tested the concept that gene imbalance across an extra chromosome can be de facto corrected in DS patient stem cells by manipulating a single gene, XIST. Using zinc finger nucleases, we targeted a large, inducible XIST transgene into the Chr21 DYRK1A locus, in DS pluripotent stem cells. XIST RNA coats Chr21 and triggers stable heterochromatin modifications, chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation to form a “Chr21 Barr Body.” This provides a model to study human chromosome inactivation and creates a system to investigate genomic expression changes and cellular pathologies of trisomy 21, free from genetic and epigenetic noise. more...
