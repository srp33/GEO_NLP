(Submitter supplied) Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing and metabolism are two hallmarks of MYC-driven cancers. Pharmacological inhibition of both processes has been extensively investigated as potential therapeutic avenues in preclinical and clinical studies. However, how pre-mRNA splicing and metabolism are orchestrated in response to oncogenic stress and therapies is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Jumonji Domain Containing 6, Arginine Demethylase and Lysine Hydroxylase, or JMJD6, acts as a hub connecting splicing and metabolism in MYC-driven neuroblastoma. more...

2. TDP-43, a novel rhythmic protein, regulates the ubiquitination degradation of BMAL1, cellular glucose utilization and energy synthesis
(Submitter supplied) In this study, we discovered that TDP-43 expression followed a rhythmic pattern, which was influenced by sleep deprivation. Knockdown of TDP-43 altered the mRNA and protein expression of multiple circadian genes, including BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1, and PER2. Furthermore, TDP-43 knockdown affected the autonomous circadian wheel behavior, as well as the cognitive and balance abilities of mice. We also revealed that TDP-43 regulated the deubiquitination of BMAL1 by influencing the alternative splicing of USP13, thereby affecting the expression of USP13 and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of BMAL1. more...

3. Histone lysine demethylase 4 family proteins maintain the transcriptional program and adrenergic cellular state of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification (MNA) is a high-risk disease that requires long-term intensive multimodal therapies. Less than 50% survival rate of high-risk patients has prompted active and extensive studies to seek more effective therapies against MNA neuroblastomas but with few successes. We show that MYCN transdifferentiates the neuroblastoma cells from mesenchymal state to adrenergic state accompanied with induction of histone lysine demethylase 4 family members (KDM4A-C), all of which act in concert to control the expression of MYCN and adrenergic core regulatory transcription factors (CRC TF). more...

4. KDM4 inhibition disrupts the core regulatory transcriptional circuitry in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) A small set of interconnected lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) form a core regulatory circuitry (CRC) that establishes and maintains cell identity and grants selective dependencies of distinct cancer types. However, effective therapies to targeting CRC TFs remain lacking. Here, we show that the best-in-class KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 has a potent anticancer activity in MYCN-driven high-risk neuroblastoma and significantly represses the CRC TFs including MYCN, HAND2, ASCL1, PHOX2B by disrupting the super-enhancers that dominate the expression of CRC TFs. more...

9. Loss of ATM activity in human neurons increases   poly-ADP-ribose and RNA-DNA hybrids at active promoters
(Submitter supplied) The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response and also an important sensor of oxidative stress in mammals. Loss of ATM or its ability to be activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generates high levels of ROS and an excess of single-strand DNA breaks in non-dividing human cells. Here we map locations of poly-ADP-ribose and RNA-DNA hybrid accumulation genome-wide in post-mitotic human neurons with ATM inhibition and find that these locations are coincident with promoter regions, active transcription histone marks, and sequences with high GC content. more...

11. SNRPD3 preserves balanced MYCN-driven alternate splicing and represents a therapeutic vulnerability in neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Many of the pro-tumorigenic functions of the oncogene MYCN are attributed to its regulation of global gene expression programs. Alternative splicing is another important regulator of gene expression and has been implicated in neuroblastoma development, however, the molecular mechanisms behind this remain unknown.  We found that MYCN up-regulated the core spliceosomal protein, SNRPD3, in models of neuroblastoma initiation and progression. more...

14. A mutation in the low complexity domain of splicing factor hnRNPA1 linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disrupts distinct neuronal RNA splicing networks
(Submitter supplied) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons. Human genetic studies have linked mutations in RNA binding proteins as causative for this disease. The hnRNPA1 protein, a known pre-mRNA splicing factor, is mutated in some ALS patients. Here, two human cell models were generated to investigate how a mutation in the C-terminal low complexity domain (LCD) of hnRNPA1 can cause splicing changes of thousands of transcripts that collectively are linked to the DNA damage response, cilia organization and translation. more...

15. Deterministic nuclear reprogramming of mammalian nuclei to a totipotency-like state by Amphibian meiotic oocytes for stem cell therapy in humans
(Submitter supplied) The ultimate aim of nuclear reprogramming is to provide stem cells or differentiated cells from unrelated cell types as a cell source for regenerative medicine. A popular route towards this is transcription factor induction, and an alternative way is an original procedure of transplanting a single somatic cell nucleus to an unfertilized egg. A third route is to transplant hundreds of cell nuclei into the germinal vesicle (GV) of a non-dividing Amphibian meiotic oocyte, which leads to the activation of silent genes in 24 hours and robustly induces a totipotency-like state in almost all transplanted cells. more...

37. Transition of allele-specific DNA hydroxymethylation at regulatory loci is associated with phenotypic variation in monozygotic twins discordant for psychiatric disorders
(Submitter supplied) Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are complex genetic mental illnesses. Their non-Mendelian features such as monozygotic twins discordant for SCZ or BPD are likely complicated by environmental modifiers of genetic effects. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important epigenetic marker in gene regulation and whether its links with genetic variants contribute to the non-Mendelian features remain largely unexplored. more...

40. Transcriptional effects of SMARCA4 inhibition on neuroblastoma cells [4sU RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) To reveal fast-acting transcriptional effects of SWI/SNF inhibition in neuroblastoma cells, we performed 4sU metabolic labeling followed by RNA-seq in IMR-32, KELLY, and SK-N-DZ cells and compared the effects of BRM014 with DMSO vehicle control. We also compared these effects to auxin-induced degradation of SMARCA4 in engineered cells with the minimal auxin-induced degron (SMARCA4-mAID). Analysis of transcripts reveal that SMARCA4 inhibition leads to suppression of transcripts involved in the G1 checkpoint.

77. Inhibition of mitochondrial transcription by the neurotoxin MPP+
(Submitter supplied) The neurotoxin MPP+ triggers cell death of dopamine neurons and induces Parkinson’s disease symptoms in mice and men, but the immediate transcriptional response to this neurotoxin has not been studied. We therefore treated human SH-SY5Y cells with a low dose (0.1 mM) of MPP+ and measured the effect on nascent transcription by precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq). We found that transcription of the mitochondrial genome was significantly reduced already after 30 min, whereas nuclear gene transcription was unaffected. more...

80. Single-cell sequencing of neuroblastoma CHP134 cells treated with doxazosin, isotretinoin (13cRA) and their combination.
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive childhood tumor, with high-risk cases having a 5-year overall survival probability of about 50%. The multimodal therapeutic scheme of NB includes isotretinoin (13cRA), used in the post-consolidation phase as an anti-proliferative and pro-differentiative agent to minimize residual disease and prevent relapse.   Administration of doxazosin, a safe α1-antagonist used in pediatric patients, with 13cRA in NB xenografted mice exerted a marked control of tumor growth, while each of the two drugs alone was ineffective. more...

86. Control of cell identity and early neuronal fate commitment by the enhancer module of Integrator [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Cell fate specification occurs via coordinated transcriptional changes in pluripotent cells, resulting in progressive commitment towards distinct lineages. Lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs), through their intrinsic DNA-binding ability, operate as master orchestrators of early and late developmental processes by turning on select cis-regulatory enhancers and proximal promoter elements. TF binding ultimately drives recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery that comprises RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and a host of polymerase-associated multiprotein complexes, including the metazoan-specific Integrator complex. more...

149. LIN28B alters ribosomal dynamics to promote metastasis in MYCN-driven malignancy (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) High expression of LIN28B is associated with aggressive malignancy and poor survival. Here, probing MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma as a model system, we show that LIN28B expression is associated with enhanced cell migration in vitro and invasive and metastatic behavior in murine xenografts. Sequence analysis of the polyribosome fraction of LIN28B-expressing neuroblastoma cells revealed let-7 independent enrichment of transcripts encoding components of the translational and ribosomal apparatus, particularly those with higher Adenine/Uridine (AU)-content, and depletion of GC-rich transcripts of neuronal developmental programs. more...

151. Reliable assessment of telomere maintenance mechanisms in neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM) are a hallmark of high-risk neuroblastoma, and are conferred by activation of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). However, detection of TMM is not yet part of the clinical routine, and consensus on TMM detection, especially on ALT assessment, remains to be achieved. Based on our results we here propose a workflow to reliably detect TMM in neuroblastoma. more...

(Submitter supplied) Adrenal glands are the major organs releasing catecholamines and regulating our stress response. The mechanisms balancing generation of adrenergic chromaffin cells and protecting against neuroblastoma tumors are still enigmatic. Here we revealed that serotonin (5HT) controls the numbers of chromaffin cells by acting upon their immediate progenitor “bridge” cells via 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A), and the aggressive HTR3Ahigh human neuroblastoma cell lines reduce proliferation in response to HTR3A-specific agonists. more...

219. Expression data from neuroblastoma cells treated with GSK-J4 or KTP-330
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma (NB) is a common pediatric malignancy tumor with poor outcome. Recent studies show that GSK-J4, an inhibitor of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) demethylases, and KTP-330, a clinically available inhibitor of XPO1 protein, are promising anti-cancer agents. However, their molecular mechanisms  in neuroblastoma are still unclear. In this study, we used microarrays to analyze the global change in gene expression as a result of GSK-J4 or KTP-330 treatment in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.

However, clinical trials indicate that patient stratification based upon the mechanism of action of indisulam may be required to achieve the best response. Here we show that neuroblastoma, a MYC-driven cancer characterized by splicing dysregulation, requires RBM39 for survival, expresses high levels of DCAF15 among different solid tumor lineages, and is the most sensitive cancer lineage to indisulam that achieves therapeutic effect by specifically targeting RBM39 in neuroblastoma. more...

241. KDM6B promotes activation of the oncogenic CDK4/6-pRB-E2F pathway by maintaining enhancer activity in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma  [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The H3K27me2/me3 histone demethylase KDM6B is over-expressed in neuroblastoma and is essential to neuroblastoma cell survival. While the KDM6B inhibitor, GSK-J4, has shown activity in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, the mechanism of action remains poorly defined. We demonstrate that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of KDM6B downregulates the pRB-E2F transcriptome and MYCN expression. Chemical genetic analyses show that high expression of the E2F transcriptome is positively correlated with sensitivity of cancer cells to GSK-J4. more...

245. Retinoic acid rewires the adrenergic core regulatory circuitry of neuroblastoma but can be subverted by enhancer hijacking of MYC or MYCN (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma cell identity depends on a core regulatory circuit (CRC) of transcription factors that incorporate MYCN to drive the oncogenic gene expression program. For neuroblastomas dependent on the adrenergic CRC, treatment with retinoids can inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation in both primary neuroblastomas and cell lines; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that when MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas cells are treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), they undergo modifications of histone H3K27 acetylation and methylation that decommission super-enhancers driving the expression of PHOX2B and GATA3, together with the activation of new super-enhancers that drive high levels of expression of MEIS1, HIC1 and SOX4. more...

(Submitter supplied) CHD5, a tumor suppressor at 1p36, is frequently lost or silenced in poor prognosis neuroblastoma (NB) and many adult cancers. The role of CHD5 in metastasis is unknown. We confirm that low expression of CHD5 is associated with stage 4 NB. Forced expression of CHD5 in NB cell lines with 1p loss inhibited key aspects of the metastatic cascade in vitro: anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion. more...

262. Human embryonic stem cell-derived neural crest model for neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma is a common childhood malignant tumor of neural crest origin with remarkable heterogeneity in outcomes. Amplification of the oncogene MYCN is strongly associated with highly malignant behaviour and poor prognosis. Here, we used human ESC-derived neural crest model to recapitulate the initiation of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma and to identify MYCN downstream effectors. Our results show that induced deregulation of MYCN in human neural crest progenitor cells is sufficient to induce tumors that recapitulate the pathological and molecular features of human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma(MNA-NB). more...

275. Small molecule activation of a pseudoexon triggers huntingtin-lowering (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT). The resultant mutant protein is ubiquitously expressed and drives pathogenesis of HD through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. Animal models of HD have demonstrated that reducing huntingtin protein (HTT) levels alleviates HD-associated motor and neuropathological abnormalities, confirming the importance of huntingtin-lowering as a therapeutic approach. more...

(Submitter supplied) Gain at chromosome 17q21 in neuroblastoma and is associated with a poor prognosis, independent of MYCN amplification status. Several potential proto-oncogenes have been identified in this region, one of them - insulin-like growth-factor-2 mRNA binding protein (IGF2BP1) – is expressed at high levels in stage 4 tumors, and associated with overall lower patient survival. Here, we demonstrate that down-regulation of IGF2BP1 activity, either by transcript silencing or chemical inhibition, suppresses neuroblastoma cell growth. more...

300. Adenosine triphosphate Binding Cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) overexpression reduces APP processing and increases alpha- versus beta-secretase activity, in vitro.
(Submitter supplied) The organic anion transporter Adenosine triphosphate Binding Cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1), also known as MRP1, has been demonstrated in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to export amyloid beta (Abeta) from the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier to the periphery, and that pharmaceutical activation of ABCC1 can reduce amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. Here, we show that ABCC1 is not only capable of exporting Abeta from the cytoplasm of human cells, but also that it's overexpression significantly reduces Abeta production and increases the ratio of alpha- versus beta-secretase mediated cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), likely via indirect modulation of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase activity.

(Submitter supplied) Targeting the function of MYC proteins for therapy is a major challenge in tumor biology. MYC proteins are transcription factors that can globally release RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from core promoters. In neuroblastoma, the MYC paralogue, MYCN, and the Aurora-A kinase form a complex during S phase that stabilizes MYCN and enhances Aurora-A kinase activity. Here we show that Aurora-A phosphorylates histone H3 at serine 10 in S phase and suppresses transcription-dependent R-loop formation. more...

352. High Throughput pMHC-I Tetramer Library Production Using Chaperone Mediated Peptide Exchange
(Submitter supplied) Peptide exchange technologies are essential for the generation of pMHC-multimer libraries for probing diverse, polyclonal TCR repertoires in various settings. Here we report, using the molecular chaperone TAPBPR, a robust method for the capture of stable, empty MHC-I molecules, which can be readily tetramerized and loaded with peptides of choice in a high-throughput manner. Alternatively, catalytic amounts of TAPBPR can be used to exchange ‘goldilocks’ peptides with high-affinity peptides of interest in an overnight reaction. more...

365. Studying the selectivity of a small molecule Synucleozid on transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) One strategy to drugging undruggable proteins is to directly target the mRNA that encodes them, thereby inhibit translation and reducing protein levels. Inforna, a sequence-based design approach to target RNA, enables the design of a small molecule Synucleozid that binds SNCA mRNA which encodes alpha-synuclein.  Herein, we investigate the selectivity of Synucleozid on the whole transcriptome. Based on mechanistic studies, Synucleozid targets IRE locates in 5' UTR of SNCA mRNA and reduces alpha-synuclein protein levels by decreasing the amount of SNCA mRNA loaded into polysomes. more...

The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. more...

(Submitter supplied) Stochastic activation of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) α, β, and γ genes generates a cell-surface identity code in individual neurons that functions in neural circuit assembly. Here, we show that Pcdhα gene choice involves the activation of an antisense promoter located in the first exon of each Pcdhα alternate gene. Transcription of an antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from this antisense promoter extends through the sense promoter, leading to DNA demethylation of the CTCF binding sites proximal to each promoter. more...

(Submitter supplied) Deregulation of the MYCN gene drives the development of neuronal and neuroendocrine tumors and is often associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Here we show that activation of MYCN in human neuroblastoma cells induces promoter escape of RNAPII. If pause release of RNAPII fails, MYCN recruits the BRCA1 protein to promoter-proximal regions. Recruitment of BRCA1 prevents MYCN-dependent accumulation of stalled RNAPII and enhances transcriptional activation by MYCN. more...

Although SETD1A is known to encode a histone methyltransferase, the consequences of reduced SETD1A activity on gene expression in neural cells have, to date, been unknown. To explore transcriptional changes through which genetic perturbation of SETD1A could confer risk for schizophrenia, we have performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of a commonly used human neuroblastoma cell line in which SETD1A expression has been experimentally reduced using RNA interference (RNAi). more...

424. Direct Targeting of MYCN Gene Amplification by CRISPR/Cas9 in Neuroblastoma Cells (CHP-134)
(Submitter supplied) Amplification of MYCN plays a pivotal role in multiple types of tumors and correlates with poor prognosis in high-risk neuroblastoma. Despite recent advances in the treatment of neuroblastoma, no approaches directly target the master oncogene MYCN. Difficulties in targeting the MYCN protein have inspired us to develop a new gene level inhibitory strategy using a sequence-specific gene regulator. Here we generated a MYCN-targeting pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide, MYCN-A3, which directly binds to and alkylates DNA at homing motifs within MYCN transcript. more...

428. Transcriptional changes associated with resistance to JQ1 treatment in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Drug resistance is a major clinical challenge in achieving durable responses to targeted cancer therapeutics.  Resistance mechanisms to new classes of epigenetic-targeted drugs entering the clinic remain largely unexplored.  We used BET inhibition in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma as a prototype to model innate and acquired resistance to chromatin remodeling inhibitors in cancer. Genome-scale, pooled lentiviral ORF and CRISPR knockout rescue screens nominated the PI3K pathway as a key signaling node that mediates resistance to BET inhibition. more...

456. Predicting Neuroblastoma Using Developmental Signals and a Logic-Based Model
(Submitter supplied) Genomic information from human patient samples of pediatric neuroblastoma cancers and known outcomes have led to specific gene lists put forward as high risk for disease progression. However, the reliance on gene expression correlations rather than mechanistic insight has shown limited potential and suggests a critical need for molecular network models that better predict neuroblastoma progression. In this study, we construct and simulate a molecular network of developmental genes and downstream signals in a 6-gene input logic model that predicts a favorable/unfavorable outcome based on the outcome of the four cell states including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. We simulate the mis-expression of the tyrosine receptor kinases, trkA and trkB, two prognostic indicators of neuroblastoma, and find differences in the number and probability distribution of steady state outcomes. We validate the mechanistic model assumptions using RNAseq of the SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line to define the input states and confirm the predicted outcome with antibody staining. Lastly, we apply input gene signatures from 77 published human patient samples and show that our model makes more accurate disease outcome predictions for early stage disease than any current neuroblastoma gene list. These findings highlight the predictive strength of a logic-based model based on developmental genes and offer a better understanding of the molecular network interactions during neuroblastoma disease progression.

458. Super-enhancer Driven Core Regulatory Circuitry in MYCN-amplified Neuroblastoma [array]
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional dysregulation plays a major role in the development and progression of human tumors such as pediatric neuroblastoma. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the relationship between genes required for neuroblastoma cell growth and survival and the transcriptional core regulatory circuitry (CRC) that controls the gene expression program. A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen for oncogenic dependencies revealed that 143 genes are essential for cell survival and growth in neuroblastoma relative to other cancers, including many super-enhancer (SE) regulated transcription factors. more...

463. EZH2 regulates neuroblastoma cell differentiation via NTRK1 promoter epigenetic modifications
(Submitter supplied) The polycomb repressor complex 2 molecule EZH2 is now known to play a role in essential cellular processes, namely, cell fate decisions, cell cycle regulation, senescence, cell differentiation, and cancer development/progression. EZH2 inhibitors have recently been developed; however, their effectiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms in many malignancies have not yet been elucidated in detail. Although the functional role of EZH2 in tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) has been investigated, mutations of EZH2 have not been reported. A Kaplan-Meier analysis on the event free- and overall survival of NB patients indicated that the highexpression of EZH2 correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. In order to elucidate the functional roles of EZH2 in NB tumorigenesis and its aggressiveness, we knocked down EZH2 in NB cell lines using lentivirus systems. The knockdown of EZH2 significantly induced NB cell differentiation, e.g. neurite extension, and the neuronal differentiation markers, NF68 and GAP43. EZH2 inhibitors also induced NB cell differentiation. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Human Gene Expression Microarrays and found that NTRK1 (TrkA) is one of the EZH2-related suppression targets. The depletion of NTRK1 canceled EZH2 knockdown-induced NB cell differentiation. Our integrative methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NB cell lines and clinical samples clarified that the NTRK1 P1 and P2 promoter regions were regulated differently by DNA methylation and EZH2-related histone modifications. The NTRK1 transcript variants 1/2, which were regulated by EZH2-related H3K27me3 modifications at the P1 promoter region, were strongly expressed in favorable, but not unfavorable NB. The depletion and inhibition of EZH2 successfully induced NTRK1 transcripts and functional proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that EZH2 plays important roles in preventing the differentiation of NB cells and also that EZH2-related NTRK1 transcriptional regulation may be the key pathway for NB cell differentiation.

494. Cell-cycle-resolved analysis of RNA expression in neuroblastoma cells upon MYCN knockdown
(Submitter supplied) Previous studies of c-MYC or MYCN effects on the cellular transcriptome have been performed with unsynchronized tumor cell populations. We reasoned that these results might have been influenced by different cell-cycle profiles of cells with high or low MYC levels  as the expression of a large part of the genome varies with cell-cycle phase. To correct for this potentially confounding effect, we performed RNA sequencing in cell-cycle-synchronized neuroblastoma cells and then compared the transcriptomes of cells with high and low MYCN in equivalent cell-cycle phases.

To understand the molecular mechanisms mediating NB metastasis, we developed a mouse model using intracardiac injection and in vivo selection to isolate metastatic subpopulations that exhibited a higher propensity for bone and central nervous system metastases. Gene expression profiling revealed two distinct subtypes, primary and metastatic, with differential regulation of 412 genes and multiple pathways including CADM1, SPHK1, and YAP/TAZ whose expression independently predicted survival. more...

(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma (NB) tumours have the highest incidence of spontaneous remission, especially among the stage 4s NB subgroup affecting infants. Clinical distinction of stage 4s from lethal stage 4 can be difficult, but critical for therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate differential gene expression amongst infant disseminated NB subgroups. Thirty-five NB tumours from patients diagnosed at < 18 months (25 stage 4 and 10 stage 4s), were evaluated gene expression analyses. more...

(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastic tumours (NBTs) represent a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplastic diseases associated with multiple genetic alterations. Structural and numerical chromosomal changes are frequent and are predictive parameters of NBTs outcome. We performed a comparative analysis of the biological entities constituted by NBTs with different ploidy status. Gene expression profiling of 49 diagnostic primary near-triploid (n= 22) and near-diploid/tetraploid (n=27) NBTs performed using Affymetrix U95Av2 arrays, revealed distinct expression profiles associated with each NBT subgroup. more...

(Submitter supplied) MEIS2 has an important role in development and organogenesis, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer. The molecular basis of MEIS2 action in tumorigenesis is not clear. Here, we show that MEIS2 is highly expressed in human neuroblastoma cell lines and is required for neuroblastoma cell survival and proliferation. Depletion of MEIS2 in neuroblastoma cells leads to M phase arrest and mitotic catastrophe, whereas ectopic expression of MEIS2 markedly enhances neuroblastoma cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. more...

(Submitter supplied) FOXO transcription factors control cellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which critically contribute to cell survival and cell death in neuroblastoma. Here, we report that C10orf10, also named “Decidual Protein induced by Progesterone (DEPP)”, is a direct transcriptional target of FOXO3 in human neuroblastoma. As FOXO3-mediated apoptosis involves a biphasic ROS accumulation, we analyzed cellular ROS levels in DEPP-knockdown cells by live-cell imaging. more...

(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid malignancy derived from neural crest cells. Better elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the aggressive progression of neuroblastoma is needed for improving the therapeutic efficiencies. Since previous studies indicate that histone H2A type 2-B (H2AB), a histone H2A variant locating at chromosome 1q21.2 region, is up-regulated in neural progenitor cells and early motor neurons, we hypothesized that H2AB might participate in the progression of neuroblastoma. more...

(Submitter supplied) Two genes have a synthetic lethal relationship when silencing or inhibition of one gene is only lethal in the context of a mutation or activation of the second gene. This situation offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, as inhibition of such a gene will only trigger cell death in tumor cells with an activated second oncogene but spare normal cells without activation of the second oncogene. Here we present evidence that CDK2 is synthetic lethal to neuroblastoma cells with MYCN amplification and overexpression. more...

682. Transient treatment with epigenetic modifiers yields stable neuroblastoma stem cells resembling aggressive large-cell neuroblastomas
(Submitter supplied) Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are plastic in nature, a characteristic that hampers cancer therapeutics.  Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of neural crest origin, and half of the cases are highly aggressive.  By treating NB cell lines (SKNAS, SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, SY5Y) with epigenetic modifiers for a short time followed by sphere-forming culture conditions, we have established stem cell-like NB cells that are phenotypically stable for over a year. more...

693. Functional MYCN signature predicts outcome of neuroblastoma irrespective of MYCN amplification. 
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system. MYCN (V-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived [avian]) is amplified in 20% of neuroblastomas, and these tumors carry a poor prognosis. However, tumors without MYCN amplification also may have a poor outcome. Here, we identified downstream targets of MYCN by shRNA-mediated silencing MYCN in neuroblastoma cells. more...

Neuroblastomas belong to the group of neuroblastic tumors, together with the more benign, differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas. Little is known of the genes driving the differentiation processes in these tumor types. A search for the transcription factors differentially expressed between ganglioneuromas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and neuroblastomas in a series of 110 neuroblastic tumors (NB110) identified a large number of HOX- and TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension)-class homeobox transcription factor genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) PHF8 is a histone demethylase associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). It has been described as a transcriptional coactivator involved in cell cycle progression, but its physiological role is still poorly understood. Here we show that PHF8 controls the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization such as RhoA, Rac1 and GSK3β. A lack of PHF8 not only results in a cell cycle delay but also in a disorganized actin cytoskeleton and impaired cell adhesion. more...

704. Nanomolar treatment with epigenetic drug combination induces genome-wide methylation and expression alterations in neuro-ectodermal cell lines [mRNA]
(Submitter supplied) Abstract: Epigenetic alterations are a fundamental aspect of cancer cells, and epigenetic drugs are currently used in clinical practice for hematological malignancies. Pediatric neuro-ectodermal tumors originate from neural crest cells and show epigenetic defects of apoptotic pathways, which makes the introduction of epigenetic drugs in this patient category logical. However, the young age of these patients is accompanied by ongoing developmental processes which are regulated epigenetic mechanisms, and prompted us to study molecular effects of nanomolar dosage epigenetic drugs in neuro-ectodermal tumor cell lines. more...

707. Oncogenic Activation Of FOXR1 by 11q23 Intrachromosomal Deletion-Fusions In Neuroblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma tumors frequently show loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11q with a shortest region of overlap in the 11q23 region.  These deletions are thought to cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes leading to haploinsufficiency.  Alternatively, micro-deletions could lead to gene fusion products that are tumor-driving.  To identify such events we analyzed a series of neuroblastomas by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and integrated these data with Affymetrix mRNA profiling data with the bioinformatic tool R2 (http://r2.amc.nl). more...

719. Patterns of histone H3 Lysine 27 monomethylation and erythroid cell-type specific gene expression [expression]
(Submitter supplied) ERYTHROID CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION Post-translational histone modifications, acting alone or in a context-dependent manner, influence numerous cellular processes via their regulation of gene expression. Monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (K27me1) is a poorly understood histone modification. Some reports describe depletion of K27Me1 at promoters and transcription start sites (TSS), implying its depletion at TSS is necessary for active transcription, while others have associated enrichment of H3K27me1 at TSS with increased levels of mRNA expression. more...

757. PRC2 in Ewing tumors
(Submitter supplied) We found the PRC2 component EZH2 to be upregulated by the pathognomonic fusion oncogene EWS-FLI1 in Ewing tumors and mesenchymal stem cells (Richter GH et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009;106:5324-9). Downregulation of EZH2 by RNA interference in Ewing tumor cell lines suppressed oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that EZH2 might play a central role in Ewing Tumor pathology.

758. Gene expression analysis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing ZNF423
(Submitter supplied) We have identified ZNF423 (also known as Ebfaz, OAZ or Zfp423) as a component critically required for retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. ZNF423 associates with the RARα/RXRα nuclear receptor complex and is essential for transactivation in response to retinoids. Down-regulation of ZNF423 expression by RNA interference in neuroblastoma cells results in a growth advantage and resistance to RA-induced differentiation, whereas overexpression of ZNF423 leads to growth inhibition and enhanced differentiation. more...

759. Neuroblastoma cell lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions
(Submitter supplied) Hypoxia is a low oxygen condition that occurs in the developing tumor mass and that is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy. The definition of the hypoxia gene signature is fundamental for the understanding of tumor biology, as in the case of neuroblastoma, the most common pediatric solid tumor. The issue of identifying a significant group of variables in microarray gene expression experiments is particularly difficult due to the typical high dimensional nature of the data and great effort has been spent in the development of feature selection techniques. more...
